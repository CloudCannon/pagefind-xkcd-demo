[Heading:] Option A:

[A stereotypical house with a single solar panel upon its roof and an arrow from a label:] 1 m<sup>2</sup> (south-facing)

[Formula:] ($0.20/kWh)×(4 kWh/m<sup>2</sup>/day)×(1 m<sup>2</sup>)×20% = <big>$58/year</big>

[Heading:] Option B:

[A short width of the Sun's undulating 'surface', with two solar prominances/flares and at their height (but above a different part of the surface) a solar panel with some attachment upon its upper surface, depicted horizontally aligned to the Sun and with an arrow from a label:] 1 m<sup>2</sup> (downward)

[Formula:] ($0.20/kWh)×(sun luminosity/sun area)×(1 m<sup>2</sup>)×20% = <big>$22 million/year</big>

[Caption below the panel:]

Solar energy tip: To maximize sun exposure, always orient your panels downward and install them on the surface of the sun.
