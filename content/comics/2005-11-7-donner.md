[Three people stand outside a restaurant; Megan, a man with some hair (who looks like Hairy) and another shorter person, probably a woman. There is a sign above the door which says "Joe's" (presumably the name of the restaurant) and a menu next to it. Outside the door, there is a maître d' with a cap behind a lectern. There is a sign on the lectern which says "Eat in".]

maître d': Donner, party of four?

Man: Actually, never mind.

Megan: We're full.
