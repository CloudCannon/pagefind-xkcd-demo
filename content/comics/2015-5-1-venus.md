[Miss Lenhart is standing in front of an image depicting a section of a temperate Venus' surface, with greenhouses, grass, flowers and a river flowing into a sea.]

Miss Lenhart: Venus was once temperate. It had seas and rivers, and Venusians cultivated vast fields of beautiful flowers.

[The image now shows the entirety of Venus, with continents and oceans. The greenhouses appear to be fleeing from Venus.]

Miss Lenhart: Until their greenhouses fled the planet due to the runaway greenhouse effect.

[Miss Lenhart is shown to be standing in front of a classroom. Jill is sitting in the front row.]

Miss Lenhart: The Venusians pursued their greenhouses to Earth, settling in the Netherlands and kickstarting the Dutch floral industry. Any questions?

Off-panel student (presumably Jill): Because you're retiring in a month, do you just not care what you say anymore?

Miss Lenhart: *What?!* I ***ride the skies*** atop a screaming bird of truth! Also, yes, I do not.
