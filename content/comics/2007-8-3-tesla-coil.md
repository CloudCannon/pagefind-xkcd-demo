[Cueball and Black Hat stand near a tesla coil mounted on a table.]

Cueball: I finally finished my Tesla Coil!

[The room is dark; the characters appear as faint blue outlines on black background. Cueball turns on the Tesla Coil and it sparks white static electricity.]

*click*

Black Hat: Cool, butâ€”

Black Hat: Check <u>this</u> out!

[Lightning shoots out of Black Hat's hands, Cueball appears to be in shock <!-- get it --> and awe.]

[The lights are back on, Cueball's arms are raised in amazement.]

Cueball: How did you do that?

Black Hat: The world doesn't actually make any sense. Science doesn't work. No one told you because you're so cute when you get into something.

[Black Hat floats up the frame, and Cueball is pointing towards Black Hat.]

Black Hat: Still, neat toy.

Cueball: Now you're hovering!

Black Hat: I guess you're still not getting this.
