  I am firmly of the opinion that if something doesn't have a year on it, every time the expiration date rolls around it is good again for the two weeks preceding that date.

[Cueball is holding a yogurt cup at arm's length. Waves of stink are rising from it.]

Cueball: Oh God, how old is this yogurt in your fridge?

[Someone speaks from off-panel.]

Friend: What's the expiration date?

[Cueball holds up the cup to look at the bottom.]

Cueball: May 12th, but there's no year.

[From off-panel again.]

Friend: It's May 7th. So it's fine.

[Now the second person is on panel, and Cueball speaks from off-panel. The second person is sitting down working on a laptop.]

Cueball: I'm not sure. When it was packaged, was civilization using the Gregorian or Julian calendar?

Friend: *Okay,* I'll throw it out.

Cueball: No, it might still be good!
