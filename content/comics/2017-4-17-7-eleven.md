[A person in a spacesuit is trying in vain to open the door to a convenience store, rattling the handle. Behind him stands a tall post with a big 7-eleven logo at the top and the opening hours on a bar below the logo.]

Sign: 7-Eleven

Bar: Open 24 hours

Door: *Rattle rattle*

[Caption below the panel:]
