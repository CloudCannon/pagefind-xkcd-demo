[A collection of phrases on T-shirts. The first and the last on actual black T-shirts worn by the same person, whose facial expression is more sad on the last one.]

I see dumb people

As a matter of fact the world <big>does</big> revolve around me

I can only please one person per day / today is not your day.

You know what your problem is? You're stupid.

Get a clue

Do I <u>look</u> like a people person?

Your village called / they want their idiot back

Go away

I hate you all

Die.

Help.

Maybe if this T-shirt is witty enough, someone will finally love me.

Oh God I'm so alone.
