[Cueball is sailing a lateen rigged sailboat.]

[The wind picks up, pushing the sail forward.]

[The wind builds strength. Cueball has to stand up to hold on to the main sheet, with curves depicting his tugging.]

[The distorted sail balloons out. Cueball is still holding on to the main sheet. More curves depict a stronger tugging.]

[Part of the sail separates into a bubble. Cueball starts to fall backwards. The sail begins to return to its normal shape.]

[Cueball lands on his rear and scratches his head in confusion as the sail-sized bubble floats away.]
