[[A person is sailing a cat-rigged sailboat. He detaches the mainsheet from the stern.]]

[[The sailor pulls back on the mainsheet.]]

[[The sailor stands up and pulls harder, causing the sail to arc outward.]]

[[He continues pulling as hard as he can, and the sail begins to buckle outward in a semi-circular shape.]]

[[Finally, the sail buckles so hard that a bubble forms and detaches from the sail, which begins to return to its normal shape.]]

[[The sailor sits down and scratches his head in confusion as the bubble floats away.]]
