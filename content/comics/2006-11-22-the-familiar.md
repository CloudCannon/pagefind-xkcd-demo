[A guy is standing behind his friend who sits at a computer. Both look like Cueball.]

Guy: Let's go see sunrise over the ocean.

[The friend turns and replies:]

Friend: That's a long drive, it's cold, I'm tired, and rationalizing the familiar is easy.

[The guy leaves, and in the next two frames, the friend remains at his computer alone.]
