[Two Cueball-like guys are talking. Above them is the following caption:]

Sometimes it seems bizarre to me that we take dreaming in stride.

Friend: Are you coming to dinner?

Cueball: Yeah, but first I'm gonna go comatose for a few hours, hallucinate vividly, and then maybe suffer amnesia about the whole experience.

Friend: Okay, cool.
