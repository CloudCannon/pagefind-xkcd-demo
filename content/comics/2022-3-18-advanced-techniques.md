[Miss Lenhart is using a stick to point at a whiteboard behind her while facing, presumably, a crowd of off-panel students. The white board has a drawing of a snake-shaped dragon with wings, flying with it's body in an S-shape. An archer is pointing an arrow up at the dragon above him. Above the drawings there are three and below two rows of unreadable text and equations.]

Miss Lenhart: To solve this equation, we invoke Gauss's operator to transform it into a dragon.

Miss Lenhart: Then we slay the dragon with Hilbert's Arrow, and transform its corpse back into the solution.

Off-panel voice: Just to be clear, this is a metaphor, right?

Miss Lenhart: Does this ***look*** like English class?!
