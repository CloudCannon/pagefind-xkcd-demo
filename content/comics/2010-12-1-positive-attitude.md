  Having a positive attitude is almost tautologically good for your mental health, and extreme stress can hurt your immune system, but that doesn't mean you should feel like shit for feeling like shit.

[Cueball sits hunched with his knees drawn up to him on a hospital bed, hooked up to an IV. A friend stands by.]

Cueball: I'm sick and I'm scared.

Friend: Well, remember - having a good attitude is the most important thing. Think positively and you'll get better.

[Darkness surrounds Cueball on the bed. The friend is off-screen.]

Cueball: So if I'm sad or afraid or feel like crap sometimes, then...

Friend: ...then if you don't recover, it will be *your fault.*

[Cueball clutches his hands to his face and leans back.]

Cueball: Well that makes me feel even worse.

Friend: See? You're doing this to yourself.

Cueball: No!

Friend: Stop it!

Cueball: Argh!

[Close up on Cueball, holding up his hand, pointing to himself.]

Cueball: Okay, you know what? Screw this. My attitude isn't my problem. - My *disease* is my problem, and I'm treating it. - I'm going to be glum and depressed and pessimistic some days, and I'm going to ***get better anyway.***

[Cueball sits on the edge of the bed, his friend still standing in front of him.]

Cueball: Wait, that ended up sounding optimistic.

Friend: I guess you suck at pessimism.

Cueball: Maybe I'll be better at it tomorrow.
