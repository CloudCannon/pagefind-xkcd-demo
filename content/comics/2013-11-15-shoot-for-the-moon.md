[[A woman stands at a podium.]]

Woman: Students, shoot for the moon. If you miss, 

[[A surprisingly lunar-like object is starting to edge into the frame.]]

Woman: SHOOT AGAIN. Keep shooting and never stop. 

[[The moon is now almost entirely in-frame now.]]

Woman: Someday, one of us will destroy that stupid skycircle. And- ... What? What are you all-

Woman: ... It's right behind me, isn't it? Shit. Everyone act casual.
