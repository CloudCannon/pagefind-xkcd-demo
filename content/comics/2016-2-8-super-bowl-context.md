[White Hat and Cueball are walking together.]

White Hat: Did you watch the Super Bowl?

Cueball: Yes, like a third of the country.

Cueball: A fraction that is steadily *increasing* despite media fragmentation.

[White Hat stops and Cueball turn towards him.]

White Hat: Can't we just talk without your weird need to give context for everything?

Cueball: Sorry. I'll try.

White Hat: Sounds like Peyton Manning's probably going to retire.

Cueball: Yes, I... ...It...

White Hat: C'mon, you can do it...

Cueball: He...

[Cueball spreads out his arms a little as he replies with two long sentences, while White Hat walks away from him.]

Cueball: *â€”Mammals like Peyton age via a process that involves both the accumulation of damage and poorly-understood timed factors.*

Cueball: *Yet the concept of retirement itself is surprisingly recent...*

White Hat: Okay, good try. Maybe next year.
