**Who sends the first text more often?**

[A line graph with a segmented bar underneath shows a 50/50 marker in the middle while the left end is labeled "I text first 100% of the time" whereas the right end is labeled "They text first 100% of the time".]

[The bar below is divided into five sections:]

[A small part at the left, and a next, slightly larger part. The text below points to the second part:]

People who I think of as friends but secretly worry that they're just politely putting up with me

[Below this a text is shown for the first part:]

...***definitely*** just politely putting up with me

[In the middle is a big part:]

Friends

[To the right the parts are symmetric, the first is larger:]

That really nice friend who keeps inviting me to things even though I flake constantly

[The last small bar at the right:]

Automated alerts and political campaigns
