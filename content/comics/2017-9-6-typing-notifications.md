  Over the years I've decided I'd rather have them on than not, but I'm glad there aren't "has opened a blank note to compose a reply to you" notifications.

[A sequence of eight panels representing the same conversation in an electronic chat. The header always reads:]

What did you think of my show? Did you like it? Be honest!

[The reply area on the first seven panels is empty, but on the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, and 7th the input is activated and showing three dots.]

[On the last panel the reply area reads:]

It was great!

[Caption below the panels:]

My least favorite aspect of typing notifications
