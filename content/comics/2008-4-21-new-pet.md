[Megan is placing EEE PC inside hamster ball. Cueball scratches his head.]

Cueball: What are you doing?

Megan: Mounting your EEE PC in a hamster ball.

Megan: Well, the TCO of a cat is like $1,000/year, so we're saving money.

[Cueball is typing.]

Megan: Microcontrollers are all wired up! How's the brain coming?

Cueball: I've taught it obstacle avoidance and blogging.

Cueball: Aww, look, it's making friends with the Roomba.

EEE PC: *RRRRR*

Roomba: *Beep!*

[A blueprint in the background shows a webcam, RF links, bearings, omni wheels, magnets, EEE PC, omni wheels, and a battery all hooked up to Megan and Cueball's "pet."]

[Hamster ball bounces down a flight of stairs.]

Hamster ball: *Bonk bonk*

Off-panel: Man, I hope it's okay that we're laughing at this.

[Megan picks up a ball.]

Megan: I think my mothering instinct took a wrong turn somewhere.

Cueball: You mean an <u>awesome</u> turn.

[Cueball is typing.]

Megan: Too bad we can't give it a soul.

Cueball: Sure we can.

Cueball types: import soul

Megan: Oh, right. Python.
