  When I was a kid, someone told me the end of The Giver was ambiguous, which surprised me. I had just assumed Jonah died--because the book had a medal on the cover, and I knew grown-ups liked stories where sad stuff happens at the end for no reason.

[White Hat and Cueball are walking, with Cueball holding his arms out in front of him.]

White Hat: So you don't like ***any*** horror movies?

Cueball: Spooky stuff is neat but I hate jump scares and watching people get murdered. Why would you ***want*** to see that?

[Zoom in on the two.]

White Hat: It's like roller coasters. People like experiencing powerful feelings in a safe, controlled setting.

Cueball: But why not ***good*** feelings?

[In a frame-less panel Cueball stops and turns towards White Hat.]

White Hat: We've always been into tragic stories. Romeo and Juliet, Titanic...

Cueball: See, that's another thing I don't get!

[Zoom out again as White Hat walks past Cueball who now hold his arms out to the side as he looks after White Hat.]

Cueball: I loved *Titanic* because Rose and Jack found each other and seemed so happy! I just hated the ending.

White Hat: I'll be sure to give James Cameron and Shakespeare your feedback.
