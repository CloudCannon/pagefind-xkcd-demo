  I've looked through a few annotated versions of classic books, and it's shocking how much of what's in there is basically pop-culture references totally lost on us now.

[A man with a beard and a turban stands to the left of a crude wooden counter. On the right of the counter is a man with a beard and no turban. Further behind the counter is a woman with a bun kneeling on the ground and putting something into a box.]

Turban man: Nine silvers for a ham? That's too much!

No-turban man: Too much? There's a monk out back *with a ladder!*

[Both men start laughing.]

Caption: There's no reason to think that people throughout history didn't have just as many inside jokes and catchphrases as any modern group of high-schoolers.
