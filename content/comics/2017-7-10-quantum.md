[A chart with the Y-axis titled "How Philosophically Exciting the Questions Are to a Novice Student" and the X-axis titled "How Many Years of Math are Needed to Understand the Answers". The upper-right portion of the chart is labeled "Danger Zone". The following topics are charted as follows:

Basic Physics: low excitement, low prerequisites

Fluid Dynamics: low excitement, high prerequisites

Magnets: medium excitement, medium prerequisites

General Relativity: medium excitement, high prerequisites (on the border to the "Danger Zone")

Special Relativity: high excitement, low prerequisites

Quantum Mechanics: high excitement, high prerequisites (in the "Danger Zone")]
