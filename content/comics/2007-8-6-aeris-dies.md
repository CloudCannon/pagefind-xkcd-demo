[Two men are talking. The second man is sitting on the ground, hugging his knees to his chest.]

Cueball: Maggie's gone. You can't bring her back.

Friend: But I have to, she's a part of my life.

Cueball: \*sigh\*

Cueball: Okay, let me put this in your terms.

Cueball: Remember when Aeris died in FFVII? It was sad, but you had to <u>keep</u> <u>playing</u>.

Friend: Actually, I downloaded a mod to add her back to my party. It changed other character's appearances and dialogue to hers so you didn't have to lose her.

Friend: Lots of gamers did it.

[Cueball puts his hand on his chin.]

Cueball: That is troubling on several levels.

Friend: I wonder if Maggie's old dresses would fit you.
