[Megan and Cueball standing outside their en-Phelps-ified swimming pool.]

Cueball: Why is Michael Phelps in your backyard pool?

Megan: I don't know. He's been there all day. *Go home, Michael!*

Michael Phelps: Woo! 18 gold medals!

[Megan and Cueball break out a pair of pool nets and unsuccessfully try to snag Phelps.]

Cueball: Can you get him?

Megan: He's so ***fast***!

Phelps: Ha hah! Can't catch me!

*Splash splash*

[Cueball heads off to fetch something.]

[Cueball returns with a hand truck full of Jello mix.]

Phelps: Oh crap.
