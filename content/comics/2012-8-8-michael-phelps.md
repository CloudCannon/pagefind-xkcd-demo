[[Two people standing outside their en-Phelps-ified swimming pool]]

Person 1: Why is Michael Phelps in your backyard pool?

Person 2: I don't know. He's been there all day.  Go home, Michael!

Michael Phelps: Woo! 18 gold medals!

[[The two people break out a pair of pool nets and unsuccessfully try to snag Phelps]]

Person 1: Can you get him?

Person 2: He's so *fast*!

Phelps: Ha hah! Can't catch me! <<Splash splash>>

[[One person heads off to fetch something]]

[[Person returns with a hand truck full of jello mix]]

Phelps: Oh crap.
