Introducing

**The xkcd Survey**

A search for weird correlations

Note: This survey is anonymous, but

<font color="red"> all responses will be posted publicly </font>

so people can play with the data.

**take the survey**

Or click here, or here.

The whole comic is a link,

because I still haven't gotten

the hang of HTML imagemaps.
