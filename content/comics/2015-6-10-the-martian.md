  I have never seen a work of fiction so perfectly capture the out-of-nowhere shock of discovering that you've just bricked something important because you didn't pay enough attention to a loose wire.

[Cueball is sitting at a desk using a computer and White Hat walks in.]

Cueball: Ooh, trailer for *The Martian!*

White Hat: What's that?

Cueball: Movie of a book I liked.

White Hat: Should I read it?

[Cueball pivots on chair and turns away from computer to face White Hat.]

Cueball: Depends. You know the scene in Apollo 13 where the guy says "we have to figure out how to connect *this* thing to *this* thing using *this* table full of parts or the astronauts will all die?

White Hat: Yeah?

[Cueball pivots on chair again and resumes using computer while talking. White Hat looks at his smart phone.]

Cueball: *The Martian* is for people who wish the whole movie had just been more of that scene.

White Hat: How on earth did *that* become a big-budget thing with Matt Damon?

Cueball: No idea, but I'm *so* excited.
