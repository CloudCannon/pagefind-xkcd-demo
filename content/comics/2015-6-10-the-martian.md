  I have never seen a work of fiction so perfectly capture the out-of-nowhere shock of discovering that you've just bricked something important because you didn't pay enough attention to a loose wire.

[[White Hat Guy comes up behind Stickman while he is sitting at a desk looking at a laptop.]]

SM: Ooh, trailer for 

The Martian

! 

WHG: What's that?

SM: Movie of a book I liked.

WHG: Should I read it?

[[Stickman turns around in his chair to face White Hat Guy.]]

SM: Depends. You know the scene in Apollo 13 where the guy says "we have to figure out how to connect 

this

 thing to 

this

 thing using 

this

 table full of parts or the astronauts will all die?"

WHG: Yeah?

[[Stickman turns back to the laptop.]]

SM: 

The Martian

 is for people who wish the whole movie had just been more of that scene.

WHG: How on earth did 

that

 become a big-budget thing with Matt Damon?

SM: No idea, but I'm 

so

 excited.
