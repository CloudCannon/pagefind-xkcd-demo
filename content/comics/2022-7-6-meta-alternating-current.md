  It's always bothered me that you can't cancel out an inverter by putting a second inverter after it.

[Above the drawing there is a header. Below the header is a chain of rectifiers and inverters. There are seven pairs of rectifiers (the smaller ones) and inverters (the big chunky ones). The first five inverters have arrows pointing to them from a label above the chain, whereas the last five rectifiers are labeled below the chain, but also with arrows pointing to them from that label. The chain starts on the left with a mains plug (type B), followed by the first rectifier. It ends with the last inverter, and a female mains plug (type B socket) to the right. Beneath the chain there is label for the connector and an explanation in brackets below that.]
