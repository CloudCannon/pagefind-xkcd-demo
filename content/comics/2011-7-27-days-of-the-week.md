[The whole comic is a single panel, with a circular diagram of the days of the week.]

Polar graph of what stuff happens on which days, based on number of Google results for phrases like "company meeting on <day>."

The relative frequency of <day> in <phrase> is shown by the distance from the center at which <phrase>'s line crosses <day>.

Each curve is normalized to have the same number of total hits - they're not on the same scale.

It follows the plot as a sortable table:
