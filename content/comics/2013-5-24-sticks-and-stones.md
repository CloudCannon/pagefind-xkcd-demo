[A child, who looks like a miniature Cueball, is running with arms outstretched toward Cueball.]

Child: Did you hear what he said about me!?

Cueball: Well, remember: sticks and stones may break my bones, but words—

Child: —can make someone else feel happy or sad, which is literally the only thing that matters in this stupid world?

[Brief pause.]

Child: Right?

Cueball: The world isn't *that* bad.

Child: Explain the line about sticks and stones?

Cueball: ...OK, maybe it's kind of horrific.
