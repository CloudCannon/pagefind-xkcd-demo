  I understand modern autogyros are much more stable, so I've probably angered the autogyro people by impugning their safety. Once they finish building the autogyros they've been working on in their garages for 10 years, they'll come after me.

[A picture of Megan wearing aviator goggles, sitting in an autogyro and holding the control stick. The autogyro is surrounded by sentence fragments, explaining its characteristics. The one above the blade that concerns the blade has an arrow pointing from the text to the blade. The sentences in columns from the left (i.e. first four sentences to the left, then two above the autogyro's body, and finally six sentences to the right):]

Looks like a helicopter, but is nothing like a helicopter

Flies like a plane but is nothing like a plane

Sort of like a powered parachute

Rare in the US, usually homemade. Common in Europe.

Big blade on top is not powered and spins freely

Can often be flown without a license

Cheap

Needs a runway to take off, but not a long one

Can land vertically

Cannot hover

Never stalls

Extremely safe, unless you do the one thing you instinctively do to escape a stall in a normal airplane, in which case it will crash immediately.

Autogyros are weird.
