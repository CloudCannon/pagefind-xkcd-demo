[A large heading, followed by a sub-caption. Below that two lines with a statement in between:]

A timeline of Earth’s average temperature

since the last ice age glaciation

When people say “The climate has changed before,” these are the kinds of changes they’re talking about.

[A very long chart below the headings above is headed with a label for the scale of the X-axis above the chart. Below that a sub-caption. To the left an arrow down to the top of the chart pointing to the dotted curves starting point (at -4.3°C below the 1961-1990 average) with a label above the arrow. And arrow pointing left to the left of the center and another pointing right to the right of the center has labels. Below these is the temperature scale of the X-axis, with 9 ticks between the borders each with a label ranging from -4 to +4°C compared to the 1961-1990 average, but with another step in each direction not labeled towards to axis so the chart covers -5 to +5°C compared to the 1961-1990 average.]

[To the right of the chart is a gray text standing on the side down along the outer boarder of the chart with the sources for the chart:]

Source: Shakun et. al. (2012) , Marcott et. al. (2013), Annan and Hargreaves (2013) , HadCRUT4, IPCC

[The chart is split in 10 columns by the temperature scale and the borders. The two central columns are white, and then from there to the left the background becomes a faded color that changes from light blue to blue at the edge in four steps. Similarly to the right the color changes from light red to red. To the left there is a time scale taking 500 years leaps from 20,000 BCE all the way to year 1, where there are two years, one for BBC and one for CE. The 500 year leaps continue until 1500 CE and from there the steps are down to 100 years until 2100 with also present day 2016 labeled. After 1500 the CE is omitted. The labels stop there, but there is space below covering down to 2200 CE. There is clearly visible division line across the chart on the level of each of the 500 step, and fainter lines for each of the 100 steps all the way even though only the last 5 of these 100 steps are labeled. There is a similar clear line at 2016. Below each step on the Y-axis is noted, and then any text starting before the next step is noted below indented. If there are extra image belonging to text this is indented once more. The graph that the whole chart is about is a dotted line that begins at the “start” point mentioned above at -4.3°C and then begins to go straight down. It will change left and right all the way down. To being with all text and most drawings are to right of the dotted curve. Whenever something is to the left it will be noted. When it says to the left above something, and then nothing over the next, then the next will be to the right. Only at the very bottom are there more entries to the left than right. ]

20000 BCE

[An arrow goes from the dotted line to the central line at 0°C. In the middle of the line there is a temperature label:]

4.3°C

At the start of our timeline, 22,000 years ago, Earth is 4°C colder than during the late 20th century.

Boston is buried under almost a mile of ice, and the glaciers reach as far south as New York City.

[The Statue of Liberty is shown in front of a glacier front. A very tiny Cueball is on top of the glacier. The drawing is labeled and so is also the glacier.]

New York

Ice

[Cueball (wearing a knit cap with a pom-pom is seen walking in a snowy landscape leaving black footprints behind him. He walks through the white central part of the chart.]

[The skyline of Boston is shown with two clear buildings among all the other. Above it is a line and in between this area has been filled with thin lines. The drawing is labeled and so is this area. Also the skyline has an arrow pointing at it with a label:]

Boston

Ice

Modern skyline

19500 BCE

But the world is about to warm up.

By this time, humans have already spread across Africa, Eurasia, and Australia.

They’ve created painting, pottery, rope, and bows and arrows, but haven’t developed writing or farming.

19000 BCE

Changes in the Earth’s orbit mean that more sunlight reaches the polar ice…

[A line chart with a labeled Y-axis with three labeled ticks. The curve starts up and then goes down five times and up four times ending down. There is one plateau towards the end compared to the rest of the curve where the ups and downs are quite alike.]

18500 BCE

[A map of the world. At the top is a light gray area covering North America, Greenland and northern Europe and most of the northern part of Russia. A similar gray area covers Antarctica. There are two labels in the gray area above and one in the gray area below:]

Ice Ice

Ice

18000 BCE

…And the ice sheets start to melt.

17500 BCE

Temperatures have been creeping upward, but around this point, CO2 levels start to climb…

17000 BCE

…And then the warming speeds up.

16500 BCE

[Cueball is standing with a spear just the right of the graph talking to a rabbit.]

Cueball: Still pretty cold.

16000 BCE

[Megan points to the graph to the right of her and between her and Ponytail standing on the other side. Mean is the first drawing on the left side of the dotted curve, which has hardly moved since the beginning, only to just on the other side of 4°C.]

[In the right part of the chart is an explanation of the data. Below the first two lines there are four drawings each showing possible temperature swings in reality compared to the smoothed data that represents the dotted curve of the entire chart. The dotted curve is shown in all four drawings and a thin line is shown running along it but with much more fluctuation left and right on the first two, a large spike right on the third and a large bump way right on the fourth. Above these there are two labels. The first labels is inside a bracket that covers the first three, and the last label is for the last drawing. Below is a list of sources.]

Limits of this data:

Short warming or cooling spikes might be “smoothed out” by these reconstructions but only if they’re small or brief enough.

Possible Unlikely

Reconstructions are from Shakun (2012) and Marcott (2013), scaled to Annan + Hargreaves (2013) estimate for the last glacial period.

15500 BCE

In what is now France, humans paint murals on the walls of the Lascaux caves

[Hairy paints three animals, two with horns, and two humans, Cueball holding hand with Hairy who has a spear. On the other side of the central line Megan writes three letters, the last of which is reversed.]

NIИ

15000 BCE

Ice sheets around Alaska shrink, exposing a land bridge between Asia and North America

[From around the bottom if this section and down to 11500 BCE the dotted curve moved steadily to the right towards warmed temperature peaking close to -1.5°C. Before this the temperature had not moved much away from that at the start.]

14500 BCE

[Cueball walks right looking back at the graph behind him. Megan walks in front of him pointing further right.]

Cueball: Cool.

Humans reach North America.

14000 BCE

The edge of the ice withdraws from New York City and retreats North.

[A large glacier front speaks in a speech bubble with an arrow pointing at it. Behind is there are four peaks in the horizon and in front of it three small melting pools and some rocks on the ground.]

Glacier: That’s it! I’m moving to Canada!

13500 BCE

Humans domesticate dogs

(Date uncertain, may be much earlier)

[Megan and Cueball is watching a wolf looking at them.]

Megan: Okay, you can live in our homes and we’ll feed you, but we’ll still get mad f you poop on the floor.

Wolf: Deal.

Cueball: And we get to breed you to be tiny and dress you in little costumes.

Wolf: …Wait.

13000 BCE

[Randall did not use the normal spelling for Woolly Rhino, but this is an accepted alternative spelling:]

Ice sheets withdraw from Chicago

12000 BCE

Humans settle Abu Hureyra in Syria

11500 BCE

[An arrow on the left side of the dotted curve is pointing down along the dotted curve and to the left indicate temperature is declining again, meaning the dotted curve now moves left to colder temperatures. This only continues until 10500 BCE. It is only the second time something is noted on the left side after Megan at 16000 BCE]

Temperatures start to decline, mainly in the Northern hemisphere

This may be caused by changes in ocean circulation due to the floods of cold fresh meltwater flowing into the Atlantic as the North American ice sheet melts.

This cooler period is called the Younger Dryas

11000 BCE

[This is the first text to the left of the dotted curve:]

Humans reach Argentina

10500 BCE

[An arrow pointing down along the right side of the dotted curve and to the right indicate temperature is increasing again, meaning the dotted curve now moves right to hotter temperatures. This continues until 8000 BCE where it levels out just above 0°C.]
