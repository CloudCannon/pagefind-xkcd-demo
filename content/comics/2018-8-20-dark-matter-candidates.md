  My theory is that dark matter is actually just a thin patina of grime covering the whole universe, and we don't notice it because we haven't thoroughly cleaned the place in eons.

Dark matter candidates:

[A line graph is shown and labeled at left quarter in eV and further to the right in g together with some prefixes.]

[The labels read:]

µeV, meV, eV, keV, MeV, GeV, TeV, 10-18kg, ng, µg, mg, g, kg, TON, 106kg, 1012kg, 1018kg, 1024kg, 1030kg

[All items are shown in bars ranging between two approximately values:]

< 1 µeV - 10 meV: Axion

1 eV - 10 keV: Sterile neutrino

0.5 MeV (exactly): Electrons painted with space camouflage

10 GeV - 10 TeV: Neutralino

100 TeV - 10-17 kg: Q-ball

1 ng - 100 ng: Pollen

0.1 mg - 1 mg: No-See-Ums

10-1 g (exactly): Bees

10 g - 100 g: 8-balls

100 kg - TON: Space cows

TON - 109 kg: Obelisks, monoliths, pyramids

109 kg - 1033 kg: Black holes ruled out by:

109 kg - 1013 kg: Gamma rays

1013 kg - 1017 kg: GRB lensing

1015 kg - 1022 kg: Neutron star data

1021 kg - 1030 kg: Micro lensing

1024 kg - 1030 kg: Solar system stability

1030 kg - 1033 kg: Buzzkill astronomers

1033 kg - >1036 kg: Maybe those orbit lines on space diagrams are real and very heavy
