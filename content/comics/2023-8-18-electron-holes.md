[Ponytail, who has her fists clenched and a black smoke cloud above her head, is standing in front of a desk, a beam of electron holes is being fired at a printer on the desk; the beam is shown reacting to the printer, dispersing lightning bolts and 'particles' but causing no obvious damage. There are little '+' signs distributed along the beam and in the circles around the printer, though they're much easier to see in the higher-resolution version of the strip that's displayed if one zooms in on the original comic page.]

Ponytail: This doesn't even make sense! They're quasiparticles, not real-

Off-panel voice: *Pew pew pew*

Ponytail: *Stop it!*

[Caption below the panel:]

Physicists got *really* mad about my device that fires a beam of electron holes.
