[Cueball stands on the left while Beret Guy walks in from the right, carrying a smartphone.]

Beret Guy: My phone's about to die.

[The phone is now subtly larger.]

Cueball: Where'd you get a big iPhone? I didn't think they were out yet.

Beret Guy: It's my regular one. It's just dying.

[The phone increases in size again. Beret Guy now holds it in both hands.]

Beret Guy: As it consumes its battery, it heats up and expands.

Beret Guy: Soon it will swell to enormous size, engulfing us both.

[The phone is now in the size of Beret Guy's torso; he is clutching it to himself. Cueball is pointing off-panel.]

Beret Guy: Then it will collapse in a violent explosion!

Cueball: ...do you want to borrow my charger?

Beret Guy: That would only make it run out *faster!*
