  "Wait, how often are you getting bitten by snakes? And why are you boiling water?" "Dunno, the CDC people keep showing up with complicated questions about the 'history of the property' and 'possible curses' but I kinda tune them out. At least one of them offered me the flu shot."

[Megan is walking with both of her hands held up in fists. She talks to Cueball who replies to her from off-panel. His presence is revealed in the second panel.]

Megan: Yesss, I got my flu shot.

Cueball (off-panel): Nice! I got mine a few weeks ago.

Cueball (off-panel): Immunity buddies!

[Megan spreading her arms wide in front of Cueball.]

Megan: Now I can finally get bitten by all the bats I want!

Cueball: No, that's rabies, that's not what-

[Closeup of Megan's head, with Cueball's reply coming from off-panel.]

Megan: I'll be able to roll and play in the poison ivy without a care in the world!

Cueball (off-panel): Why would you do that even if the shot *did*-

[In a frame-less panel Megan is flexing her arms holding her fists up, she has turned partly away from Cueball who looks at her.]

Megan: No more slathering on sunscreen. No more rushing for antivenom after a snakebite. And now I can stop wasting time boiling contaminated water before drinking it!

[Megan is running away from Cueball, while she is holding one arm up, her hand making the like symbol with a thumbs up.]

Megan: Gonna click on every URL in every email I get, even the ones with IP addresses and weird Unicode in them!

Cueball: You know what, sure, go for it.
