[Black Hat and Danish are sitting in a train across from each other. Black Hat is writing in a journal.]

Black Hat: *blush*

Danish: I see what you did there.

[Danish stands up.]

Danish: You were trying to open me up so you could hurt my feelings.

Danish: You like to hurt people.

[Danish walks closer.]

Danish: Well, I like to hurt people too. And you know what?

[Danish is in Black Hat's face.]

Danish: \*whispering\* *I'm better at it than you.*

Danish: I'm about to hurt you more than you could ever hurt me.

Danish: See, I just saw right through you.

Danish: Alone of all the people you'll ever meet, I understand you-

[Danish strikes Black Hat's hat so it falls off.]

[Black Hat is surprised.]

[Danish catches Black Hat's hat and self-dons it]

Danish: -and you'll never see me again.

[Danish exits frame left.]

[Black Hat sits alone on the train and puts his arms down.]
