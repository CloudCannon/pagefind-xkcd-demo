[An almost white panel with a caption at the top. Then a small circle, much smaller than for instance the letter O in the text is in the center of the panel. A bending arrow points to the circle and beneath the arrow is a caption.]

Open this picture fullscreen on your phone and hold it at arm's length.

There are 50,000 galaxies in this circle.

[Caption below the panel:]

Astronomy Fact: There are too many galaxies.
