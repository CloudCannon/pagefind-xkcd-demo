  Arguably, the '1/2' in the drag equation is purely decorative, since drag coefficients are already unitless and could just as easily be half as big. Some derivations give more justification for the extra 1/2 than others, but one textbook just calls it 'a traditional tribute to Euler and Bernoulli.'

[A small panel only with text. Written as an excerpt from a mathematical text book. Begins with a number for an equation, then follows the equation written in larger letters and symbols. And below are explanations of each term in the equation. The Œº has a bar over the top and the D has a double vertical line.]

Eq. 4-15

<big>T = ùîªm<sub>0</sub>(r<sub>out</sub> - r<sub>in</sub>)<sup>ŒºÃÖ</sup></big>

T: Net rate

m<sub>0</sub>: Unit mass

(r<sub>out</sub>-r<sub>in</sub>): Flow balance<br>

ùîª, ŒºÃÖ: Decorative

Math tip: If one of your equations ever looks too simple, try adding some purely decorative constants.
