 [Megan is seated at a desk, in front of a laptop. The scene is rotated by 150Â° clockwise, so she appears to be upside down and angled.]

 [Cueball enters the scene from the right side, behind Megan. He has three question marks below his head, oriented upright in frame.]

 Megan: They announced that "down" is relative to Mars today.

 Cueball: Ugh, I hate when they make another planet the coordinate system origin.
