  It says to cut the onions into 1/4" slices, but I'd better correct for length contraction.

[In a small square panel the top part is written in black. It looks like a search from the internet and most of the top part of the browser is too small to be read. There are three small squares and a long rectangular address bar. To the right of the first small square which has a triangle inside it pointing down, there are two lines with unreadable text. Then followed by the second square, which is empty, and the address bar with a long line of unreadable text. Finally there are two lines of unreadable text before the last square which has a plus-shaped symbol inside it. Beneath this is a large header which can easily be read:]

<big>Black bean burrito bowl</big>

[Beneath this header there is a line with unreadable text, and below that line a thin empty rectangle. Beneath this is the second line of readable text. The last part indicating a time is circled in red. The readable black words are written in normal letters, as opposed to the standard of xkcd with all small caps.]

Total time: 35 minutes

[Beneath this there are three more lines of text, but this has all been written in red. Also it uses the standard xkcd all caps text format. The first line is normal text. And the last indication of time is also circled in red as the one above it, and a small double arrow goes between those two red lines around the time.]

<font color="red">My actual time: 1h 45m</font>

[Below this there are two lines with equations written in math version, but here given here in text. The second equation is split over two lines. The last result is also circled in red.]

<font color="red">t=t'/√(1-v<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup>)</font>

<font color="red">v=c\*√(1-(t'/t)<sup>2</sup>) = c\*√(1-(35/105)<sup>2</sup>) = 0.94c</font>
