[Cueball stands, talking on his cell phone.]

Cueball: Sorry for the voicemail, but I'm confused about how to reach you.

Cueball: When I text you, you reply once on GChat, then go quiet, yet answer IRC right away. I emailed you, and you replied on Skype and mentioned that the email "woke you up".

Cueball: You're very responsive - I just have no sense of how you use technology.

[An owl flies into the panel.]

Cueball: ?!?

[The owl perches on Cueballs's head. It has delivered a note to Cueball.]

Note: did you try to call me? use my google voice number next time.
