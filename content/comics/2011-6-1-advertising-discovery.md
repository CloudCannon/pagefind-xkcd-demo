Advertising discovery:

[[Person sits at computer, reading an ad on the screen. The bracketed superscripts are blue.]]

Ad: Turgidax(R) triples[2] your penis size overnight,[2][5] improving both your sexual attractiveness[2][7] and your cardiovascular health.[7][8][9]

Person (thinking): Sounds legit.

Wikipedia has trained us to believe anything followed by little blue numbers in brackets.
