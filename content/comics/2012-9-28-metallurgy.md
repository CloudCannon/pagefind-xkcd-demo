  This exotic blade was wrought from a different fallen star. The meteorite was a carbonaceous chondrite, so it's basically a lump of gravel glued into the shape of a sword. A SPACE sword!

[Cueball and Megan are in a weapon store talking to a bearded salesman wearing a hat.]

[Salesman holds up a sword.]

Salesman: This sword was forged from a fallen star. Antimony impurities make the blade surpassingly *brittle* and *weak*.

[Salesman holds up a dagger.]

Salesman: And this dagger is made of metal from a far-off kingdom. It glows blue.

Off-panel: When orcs are near?

Salesman: No, always. Radiation from the Actinium content.

Megan: ...Does it have Eldritch powers?

Salesman: It gives the wearer +2 to cancer risk.

Cueball: I think we should find another shop.
