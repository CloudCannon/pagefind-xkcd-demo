[[A man stands talking on his cellphone.]]

Phone: How do I get to your place from Lexington? 

Man: Hmm... OK, starting from your driveway, take every left that doesn't put you on a prime-numbered highway or street named for a president. 

When people ask for step-by-step directions, I worry that there will be too many steps to remember, so I try to put them in minimal form.
