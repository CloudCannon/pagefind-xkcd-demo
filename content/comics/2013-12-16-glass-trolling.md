My Hobby:

[Cueball, wearing regular glasses, is holding his smartphone up in one hand while typing, as shown with two times two small movement lines on either side of the phone. A voice from off-panel right emanates from a starburst at the frame.]

Cueball: Ooh, snow!

Off-panel voice: Oh my god, it's somehow even *more* annoying than if you had it.
