[In front of a starry black sky, Megan looks at the stars through a telescope about twice her size, touching it at the base. She remains in the exact same position through all four panels.]

[Beret Guy enters the panel holding a ladder and a magnifying glass.]

[Beret Guy places the ladder next to Megan and her telescope. The ladder stands like a triangle, is slightly larger than Megan, but smaller than the telescope.]

[Beret guy climbs to the top of the ladder, and looks at the stars through a magnifying glass.]
