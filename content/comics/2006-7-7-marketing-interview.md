[Black Hat, standing in front of Cueball, who is sitting behind a executive desk, looking at some papers.]

Cueball: I've heard you're one of the best in the marketing business, but I've got your portfolio here and looks like you've never run a major campaign. Why should I hire you to head our new initiative?

[Same scene.]

Black Hat: If you don't mind my asking, what gave you the idea I was one of the best in the business?

Cueball: Hm? I don't remember. Just word of mouth or someth-- ...oh, you're good.

Black Hat: Thank you. When can I start?
