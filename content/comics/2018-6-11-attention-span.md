[Cueball and Megan are standing together.]

Cueball: I haven't read any books in forever. I have no attention span anymore.

[Zoom in on the faces of Cueball and Megan.]

Megan: Didn't you literally ***just*** spend six hours obsessively reading about the theory that *Thomas the Tank Engine* is authoritarian propaganda depicting a post-apocalyptic fascist dystopia?

[Cueball still standing there. Megan begins pacing away.]

Cueball: OK

Cueball: I mean I have no attention span for anything ***good*** anymore.

Megan: Let's check out your bookshelf, shall we?

[Cueball alone.]

Cueball: What are you-

Off-panel: I see a dragon holding a sword in its teeth on the cover of a book that's thicker than it is wide.

Cueball: And? That's a ***classic!***

Off-panel: Just saying, I don't think this is a new development.
