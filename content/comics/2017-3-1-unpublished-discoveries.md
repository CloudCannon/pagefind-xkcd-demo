  If you must know, I'm currently researching how to save this emailed tax form as a regular PDF so I can print and sign it. Our work isn't a lock for the Nobel, but we're in the running.

[Ponytail walks up to Megan, who is sitting in an office chair at a desk using her laptop.]

Ponytail: When you make a big scientific discovery, it takes a while to get it published.

Ponytail: Right?

Megan: Mm hmm.

[Zoom-in on Ponytail.]

Ponytail: So there are probably several research teams out there who are sitting on Nobel-Prize-worthy discoveries, but haven't told the rest of us yet.

Megan (off-panel): Makes sense.

[Ponytail leans over the desk, trying to see Megan's laptop screen from behind it.]

[Ponytail leans further. Megan pulls the screen down so Ponytail cannot see it.]

Ponytail: Sooo... What are you working on?

Megan: *It isn't me!*

Ponytail: I promise I won't tell.

Megan: Shoo! Go bother someone else.
