  They all made fun of Autometalogolex, but someday there will be a problem with Christmas that can only be solved if Santa somehow gets a serious headache, and then they'll see.

[Cueball is talking to a guy wearing a Santa hat.]

Cueball: You’re looking festive.

Santa Hat: I love Christmas!

Cueball: Really? Doesn’t seem like your kind of thing.

Santa Hat: It’s our most meta holiday!

[Same setting.]

Cueball: How so?

Santa Hat: All our Christmas stories now are about discovering the “true meaning of Christmas.”

[The same setting in a frame-less panel where Santa Hat shrugs.]

Cueball: Huh, yeah. And then sharing it with others.

Santa Hat: At some point, that quest itself *became* the true meaning.

[Same setting with Santa Hat holding a hand to his chin.]

Cueball: Like a word whose definition is “the act of looking up the definition of this word.”

Santa Hat: “Autometalogolex”?

Cueball: My least favorite of Santa’s reindeer.
