  There's no group chat member more enigmatic than the cool person who you all assume has the chat on mute, but who then instantly chimes in with no delay the moment something relevant to them is mentioned.

[Title at the top of the comic]:

Rules for this group chat

[A numbered list of 10 rules]:

 1.  Once you've sent a typing notification, you have to say something, c'mon.
 2.  Show you care by trimming the tracking junk off links you paste.
 3.  Do not talk about Fight Club (1999).
 4.  There are two types of chats: those with a relevant group name, and those where the name is random nonsense that changes regularly. Only the second kind are good.
 5.  When mentioning it elsewhere, always just refer to it as "the group chat" to create an aura of exclusive mystery.
 6.  Robert's Rules of Order are optional but encouraged.
 7.  Periodically part of the group will split off to form a new chat with everyone minus one person. This is how group chats reproduce; don't draw attention to it.
 8.  Since there's no algorithmic feed, the responsibility for injecting lots of garbage no one asked for falls on you.
 9.  The enumeration, in these rules, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.
 10. Sorry about all the notifications.
