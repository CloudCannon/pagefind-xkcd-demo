[The panel is upside-down. Beret Guy is holding onto the "ceiling", there is an upside-down cloud at the bottom of the panel.]

Beret guy [to the solitary cumulus cloud.]: Ohâ€”Hello down there! Welcome to My Sky!

[The panel is now oriented in the conventional sense with the ground at the bottom. Beret Guy is standing on his feet too, and the sky now shows a second cloud.]

Beret guy: It's pretty good. I like it. It's not the same color as *anything*.

[The sky is now blanketed by alto-cirrus clouds.]

Beret guy: "Wow! There are a *lot* of you! Good thing it's so big.

[The scene now depicts a party, where Beret Guy is talking to Ponytail.]

Ponytail: "And what do *you* do?"

Beret Guy: "I'm in the cloud storage business."
