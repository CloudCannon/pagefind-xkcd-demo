[This comic shows a pie chart with 5 slices, each with a label and a line pointing to these five different sized slices. There is a caption above the chart:]

Your activity report

[The labels on each slice is given in clockwise order starting top left. The percentages are estimated from the image and are noted in the square brackets before the transcript:]

[38%]: Going through the Star Wars movies and digitally replacing all the lightsabers with regular metal swords

[16%]: Reading every entry in the Wikipedia article List of helicopter prison escapes

[23%]: Installing and configuring time-tracking software

[02%]: Actual productive work

[21%]: Making a remix of that Jack and Diane song where every line is just "Suckin' on a chili dog outside the tastee-freez" over and over

[Below the frame there is a caption:]
