[Cueball is talking to Megan.]

Cueball: I used to think correlation implied causation.

[Cueball lift his hand while continuing to talk to Megan.]

Cueball: Then I took a statistics class. Now I don't.

[Back to the same situation as the first frame.]

Megan: Sounds like the class helped.

Cueball: Well, maybe.
