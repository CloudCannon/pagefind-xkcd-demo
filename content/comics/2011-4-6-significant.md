[A girl with a black ponytail runs up to Cueball, who subsequently points off-panel where there are presumably scientists.]

Girl with black ponytail: Jelly beans cause acne!

Cueball: Scientists! Investigate!

Scientist (off panel): But we're playing Minecraft!

Scientist (off panel): ...Fine.

[Two scientists. The man has safety goggles on, Megan has a sheet of notes.]

Scientist with goggles: We found no link between jelly beans and acne (p > 0.05).

[Back to the original two.]

Cueball: That settles that.

Girl with black ponytail: I hear it's only a certain color that causes it.

Cueball: Scientists!

Scientist (off screen): But Miiiinecraft!

[20 identical small panels follow, in 4 rows of 5 columns. The exact same picture as in panel 2 above. The scientist with goggles states the results and Megan holds some notes in her hand. The only difference from panel to panel is the color and then in the 14th panel where the result is positive and there is an exclamation from off-panel.]
