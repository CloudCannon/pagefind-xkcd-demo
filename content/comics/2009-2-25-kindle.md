[Cueball is looking at a tablet.]

Megan: A kindle? Ebooks, huh?

Cueball: Ebooks are for chumps.

Megan: Why get a kindle, then?

Cueball: One reason:

[Text is above the frame in which Cueball wanders a city with the tablet and with small bubbles forming above his head to indicate him being intoxicated.]

Cueball (narrating): <u>Free</u> cellular web access. Even if I spend months broke and drunk in a strange city, I'll still be able to use Wikipedia and Wikitravel to learn about anything I need.

[Megan takes the tablet from Cueball.]

Megan: Why does that sound familiar?

Megan: Gimme that.

[Zoom in on the top of the tablet where the name is written:]

Amazon Kindle

[Zoom out to Megan who scratches at the top of the tablet.]
