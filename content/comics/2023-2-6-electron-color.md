  There's quark color, but that's not really color--it's just an admission by 20th century physicists that numbers are boring.

[Miss Lenhart is teaching a class. A boy with spiky hair sits at his desks with his hand raised asking a question. Jill sits in front of him looking back at him while leaning an arm on the back of her chair.]

Miss Lenhart: You have a question?

Boy: Yeah-What color are electrons and protons? Are they yellow? Red? Blue?

[Zoom in on Miss Lenhart's head.]

Miss Lenhart: Subatomic particles don't have a color.

Miss Lenhart: They're too small to interact with visible light, so "color" isn't even defined for them.

[Zoom back out but only showing Miss Lenhart. Three pupils reply from off-panel with speech lines coming from starburst at the right edge of the panel.]

Miss Lenhart: That said, electrons are ***definitely*** yellow.

Off-panel voice 1: I knew it!

Off-panel voice 2: And protons are red, right?

Off-panel voice 3: *What?* No! They're gray!
