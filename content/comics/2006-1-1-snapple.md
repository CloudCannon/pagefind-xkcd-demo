{{Author's Comment: This one is entirely James' fault.}}

[[Two guys are standing and talking.]]

Right Guy: Here, take a bite of this Snapple.

Left Guy: food!

[[Guy on the right takes a bite]]

Right Guy: Ow! What is this? 

<<CLINK>>

Left Guy: It's an apple infused with tin.

[[The two guys continue to stand as if frozen]]
