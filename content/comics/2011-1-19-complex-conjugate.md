  Fun fact: if you say this every time a professor does something to a complex-number equation that drops the imaginary part, they'll eventually move the class to another room and tell everyone else except you.

[Cueball, holding a marker pen down in one hand, is standing at a whiteboard with two equations, one of which is the time-dependent Schrodinger equation and the other shows what the wavefunction equals, but from there it becomes unreadable. Below is a graph with a bell-shaped curve. There are also other unreadable markings on the board below the second equation and next to the graph.]

Cueball: Okay, anyone who's feeling like they can't handle the physics here should probably just leave now.

[In a frame-less panel Cueball is seen writing on the whiteboard. This is seen from the side of the board, so it is just a thin line with a shelf at the bottom for putting the pen on.]

Cueball: Because I'm multiplying the wavefunction by its complex conjugate.

Cueball: That's right.

[Dramatic zoom in on Cueball appears to be writing the final part of his next equation.]

Cueball: Shit just got *real*.
