[Cueball and Jill are talking.]

Jill: What's that on your arm?

Cueball: The mark of a secret society.

Jill: If it's secret, why tell me-

Cueball: Because I know nothing. I can't betray them because I don't know who they are. I was chosen by an agent 20 years ago. That was my first and last direct contact.

Cueball: It's safer that way.

Six years later I found a piece of paper in the street with an address on it. The next day I found a can of kerosene in my garage that I'm sure I never bought.

[The panel represents these actions by highlighting the mentioned objects in a world of gray.]

I didn't know whose house it was. I just knew that I'd been given my orders. And I carried them out.

[A dark figure holding the kerosene is silhouetted against a flame.]

Cueball: I don't know who or what we're fighting.

Cueball: Maybe we're the bad guys.

Cueball: It doesn't matter to me.

Cueball: It's enough to know that there are forces working beneath the chaos of life, and I'm a *part* of them.

Cueball: That whatever this "Pen Fifteen" club is,

Cueball: I'm *in* it.
