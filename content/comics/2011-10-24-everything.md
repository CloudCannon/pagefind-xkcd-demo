[[Person 1 drags a small wagon and a bag full of various items]]

Person 1: You are not the light of my life. Making you happy isn't my greatest dream.

[[Person 1 places the items in an even bigger pile of even more random items]]

Person 1: Your smile is not all I live for. I've got my own stuff going on. But you're strange and fascinating and I've never met anyone like you.

[[Person 1 stares in awe as Person 2 assembles the items into a gargantuan, intoxicatingly complex machine]]

Person 1: I want to give you everything just to see what you'd do with it.
