Once upon a midnight dreary

While I pondered, weak and weary,

Over many a quaint and curious

Volume of forgotten lore

While I nodded, nearly napping,

Suddenly there came a tapping

As if someone gently rapping

Rapping at my chamber door...

[A door opens, revealing Eminem wearing a hoodie.]

*click*

*creak*

Eminem: Yo.
