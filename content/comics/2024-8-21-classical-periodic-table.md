  Personally I think mercury is more of a 'wet earth' hybrid element.

Classical Periodic Table

[A diagram in the shape of the periodic table of elements is split into labeled colored regions.  Each region is labeled with a large letter over a word in smaller letters. The colored regions are discontinuous with respect to the elements they cover.]

[The regions and colors are as follows:]

\* A: Air: light blue: Hydrogen, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Fluorine, Chlorine, and the noble gases.

\* W: Water: dark blue: Bromine and Mercury.

\* F: Fire: red-orange: Astatine, Francium, and everything from Nobelium onwards (radioactive).

\* E: Earth: brown: everything else, covers majority of the diagram.
