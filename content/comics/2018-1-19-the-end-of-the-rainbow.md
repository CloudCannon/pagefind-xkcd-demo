  The retina is the exposed surface of the brain, so if you think about a pot of gold while looking at a rainbow, then there's one at BOTH ends.

[Megan and Cueball are walking.]

Megan: There's a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.

Cueball: Rainbows are circles. They have no end.

Megan: Not quite!

[In a borderless panel, a multi-part graphic is shown depicting what Megan is describing off-panel: a short cone inside a longer cone, with the longer cone having its point starting at the Sun, the shorter cone having its point at a miniature Cueball's head, and both cones sharing the same circular base. The diagram is repeated from 3 different perspectives to make the structure easier to grasp.]

Megan (off-panel): A rainbow is light leaving the Sun, bouncing off the clouds, and converging on your eye. It's an inside-out two-ended cone.

[Megan and Cueball are still walking.]

Megan: One end of that cone is your retina.

[A wider view of the same scene, with Megan and Cueball walking on a dark ground.]

Megan: The other end is the Sunâ€”which contains quintillions of tons of gold. There's more gold in the Sun than water in the oceans.

Cueball: So there is a pot of gold!

Cueball: What about leprechauns?

Megan: All incinerated as the sun formed. Very sad.
