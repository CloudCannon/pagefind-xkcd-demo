[Cueball and Doctor Ponytail are talking to each other. Cueball is sitting on an examination table and Doctor Ponytail, in a doctor's coat, is looking down and reading from a clipboard with some illegible writing on it.]

Doctor Ponytail: I'm taking a look at your numbers, and it doesn't look good.

Doctor Ponytail: You have a lot of measurements. Quite a few variables.

[Same setting but Doctor Ponytail looks up at Cueball.]

Cueball: Is that... bad?

Doctor Ponytail: Variables are the #1 risk factor for outcomes.

Doctor Ponytail: The past is a big contributor to the future.

[Same setting but Doctor Ponytail puts her arm with the clipboard down.]

Cueball: Isn't that just causality?

Doctor Ponytail: Causality is the leading cause of death in this country.

[Same setting.]

Cueball: So what are my odds?

Doctor Ponytail: Do you have a family history?

Cueball: Of what?

Doctor Ponytail: Just, in general.

Cueball: ...Yes?

Doctor Ponytail: Oh no.
