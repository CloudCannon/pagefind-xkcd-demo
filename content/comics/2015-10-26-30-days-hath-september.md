[[Another person stuck in a Sisyphean thought bubble.]]

Person 1: ((thinking)) Thirty days hath September, April, June and November.  All the rest have 31- except February, which has 28, and leap year which makes it 29.  

- 

Wait, which month was I listening for? Oh right, October.

Did I say "October" in there? Now i can't remember.

-

30 days hath September...
