  There's a cool mental calculation hack I recently learned for this: If you open the calendar app on your phone or computer, the highest-numbered box along the bottom is equal to the number of days in the month!

[Cueball is thinking.]

Cueball: Thirty days hath September, April, June and November

Cueball: All the rest have 31â€”except February, which has 28, and leap year makes it 29.

Cueball: Wait, which month was I listening for? Oh right, October.

Cueball: Did I say "October" in there? Now I can't remember.

Cueball: 30 days hath September...

I get stuck in this loop every month.
