  And it says a lot about you that when your friends jump off a bridge en masse, your first thought is apparently 'my friends are all foolish and I won't be like them' and not 'are my friends ok?'.

[A youthful Cueball talking to an unseen parent.]

Parent: No, you can't go.

Cueball: But all my friends—

Parent: If all your friends jumped off a bridge, would you jump too?

Cueball: Oh, jeez. Probably.

Parent: What!? Why!?

Cueball: Because all my friends did.

Cueball: Think about it — which scenario is more likely:

Cueball: Every single person I know, many of them levelheaded and afraid of heights, abruptly went crazy at exactly the same time...

Cueball: ...or the bridge is on fire?

Parent: ...I, uh...hmm.

Cueball: Imagine reading this on CNN: "*Many fled their vehicles and jumped from the bridge. Those who stayed behind...*"

Cueball: Is something *good* about to happen to those people?

Parent: Maybe they'll find cookies?

Cueball: OK, *you* stay. I'm jumping.
