[Black Hat and Cueball are standing in a room with one window. Black Hat is pushing a box with an elliptical dish on top towards the window.]

*THUMPA THUMPA*

Cueball: The bass from that car is driving me nuts.

Black Hat: Me too. Give me a hand here.

[The dish is aimed out the window; Black Hat plugs the device into the wall.]

Cueball: I'm afraid to ask.

Black Hat: The system detects bass rhythms and floods the target with a phase-shifted replica signal.

Black Hat: The resonance should blow out their speakers.

[The side of a building. The dish of the device is visible through a window, emitting sound waves.]

*THUMPA THUMPA*

*BLAM*

[Back in the room.]

Black Hat: Speakers down. Now flip that red switch.

[Cueball does so with a "click."]

[Back to the outside view, more sound waves.]

***SHIRLEY SHIRLEY BO BIRLEY BANANA FANNA FO FIRLEY***

Cueball: You're horrifying.

Black Hat: Okay, now throw the switch labeled "Macarena".
