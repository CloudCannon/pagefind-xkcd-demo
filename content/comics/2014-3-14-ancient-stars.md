All of the panels of this comic are white-on-black.

[Megan and Cueball stand facing each other, looking up at the sky.]

Cueball: Just think - the light from that star was emitted thousands of years ago. It could be long gone.

[Cueball looks at Megan, who is still looking up.]

Megan: That's Sirius. It's eight light-years away.

[Cueball looks up again.]

Cueball: Oh.

[Both look at one another.]

Cueball: Just think - the light from that star was emitted in the previous presidential administration.

Megan: Hmm, doesn't pack quite the punch.
