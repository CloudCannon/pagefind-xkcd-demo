[Jason from FoxTrot is sitting at an artist's desk with a pencil, holding a phone.]

Jason: Hi, Mr. Munroe? I have a great idea! Let me draw some strips for you!

Randall, through the telephone: Fat chance, kid.

[Zoom in to Jason.]

Jason: Sudo let me draw some strips for you.

[The following are transcripts of three strips.]

[Cueball and Ponytail are looking at each other.]

Cueball: I find you more attractive than usual.

Ponytail: You do? Is it my new haircut?

[Zoom in to Cueball.]

Cueball: Actually, I think it's all the weight you've been putting on. Your gravitational pull is pretty severe.

[Cueball is now alone in the panel.]

Cueball: Just sayin'.

[Two people are in a living room. The woman is looking through a chest of drawers.]

At home with the Heisenbergs

Mrs. Heisenberg: I can't find my car keys.

Mr. Heisenberg: You probably know too much about their momentum.

[Congress is in session.  The Speaker is standing on stage in front of an American Flag hanging by an ionic column, holding up a gavel. Seven Members of Congress are seen in front of the stage: a Cueball, a Hairbun, a man with glasses, a woman with long hair, and three more Cueballs.  The first, fourth, and sixth members have their hands raised.]
