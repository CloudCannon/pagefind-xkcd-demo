[[Two people are standing together, one with long hair (presumably female) and one without visible hair (presumably male).]]

Woman: Will you marry me?

[[The male person throws his hands in the air excitedly.]]

Man: Let's find out!

[[The couple are now standing in front of an altar. A flower arch stretches over the couple and a person is standing behind the altar. The female person is wearing a knee length white dress and a veil. The male person is wearing a bow tie. They are holding hands.]]

[[The couple stand together, still dressed from the wedding and still holding hands.]]

Man: Apparently, yes!
