[Three Cueball-like guys stand in front of a sketch. The middle Cueball is the protagonist of the comic and will be called Cueball.]

Left Cueball-like guy: Do you have any thoughts regarding the particle accelerator's tertiary F.E.L. Guidance System?

Cueball: We can't put the broken part in the machine. It wouldn't smash the right tiny things together. Then the machine might break.

Cueball: That would be very bad.
