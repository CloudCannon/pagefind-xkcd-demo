  'Does the substance feel weird to the touch?' is equally likely to get the answers 'Don't be ridiculous, you would never put your hand near a sample. We have safety protocols.' and 'Yeah, and it tastes AWFUL.'

[There is a light gray caption written above two normal text captions that are above two panels:]

<font color="gray">For the last few years, I've been working on answering peoples' ridiculous questions for *What If? 2*, which sometimes meant asking scientists for help.</font>

[Caption above the left panel:]

How you'd expect scientists to respond to ridiculous questions:

[Cueball, representing Randall, stands holding a pad and pencil in front of a desk. There are a stack of three books and some papers on the desk. Hairbun is sitting on an office chair behind the desk. She is pointing at Cueball.]

Hairbun: Why would you present me with this frivolous scenario?

Hairbun: Such an absurd query can serve no practical purpose.

Hairbun: Now go; you distract me from my formulas.

[Caption above the right panel:]

How they actually respond:

[Same setting as in the left panel but the items on the desk have changed, so there are now a laptop computer and a stack with a book and some papers on the desk. Hairbun is sitting on an office chair behind the desk. She is holding another stack of papers up in both hands.]

Hairbun: Oh thank God, something fun to think about that's not grant applications.

Hairbun: Hey, do ***you*** want to fill out some grant applications? I'll give you literally anything. Coauthor credit. Powerful magnets. Do you want plutonium? I can get you plutonium.

Hairbun: What was your name again?
