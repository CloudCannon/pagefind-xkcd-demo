Man: I now have every Discworld book!

Woman: Eh. Building a Kindle collection seems pointless.

Man: Yeah, I know the DRM means I'll probably lose them someday.

Woman: No, pointless in general.

Woman: Sure, you satisfy deep magpie-like urges by building neat collections, but you still die alone.

Man: Sorry, sometimes I mistake your existential crises for technical insights.

Woman: Sometimes I mistake this for a universe that cares.
