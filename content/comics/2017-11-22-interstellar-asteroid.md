[Megan walks towards Cueball while looking at her phone. Cueball sits in front of his laptop.]

Megan: Hey, you know that asteroid that tumbled past from another star system? It's apparently really long and skinny.

Megan: Like a ratio of 6:1 or 10:1.

Cueball: Weird. Wonder what it's shaped like.

[Megan lowers her phone and looks up. Cueball looks backward.]

Megan: Without more data, it would be irresponsible to speculate further.

Cueball: So...you're going to?

Megan: *Absolutely.*

[Frameless panel focusing on Megan.]

Megan: Here are some objects with a similar shape ratio:

Megan: The 1:4:9 monolith from *2001: A Space Odyssey*.

Megan: A star destroyer.

Megan: A huge eggplant emoji.

[Same setting with Megan and Cueball.]

Megan: A statue of Weird Al. An iPhone XXXXX. Voltron.

Megan: A giant space coffin. But who could be inside? We can only guess. I'll start:

Cueball: This is all based on *how* many data points, again?

Megan: One. But it's a *perfect* fit!
