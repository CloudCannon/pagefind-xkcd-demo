[George Clinton uses a baton to point to the bottom of two equations on a blackboard. There is one more equation and a diagram on another blackboard to the right, which is cut off. There is text above:]

I once tried to start the urban legend that George Clinton has a B.A. in mathematics

[On the left blackboard there are two formulas:]

L(F(t) = F(s) = ∫<sup>∞</sup><sub>0</sub>f(t)e<sup>-st</sup>dt

L<sup>-1</sup> (F(s)) = f(t) = ∫<sup>∞</sup><sub>0</sub> F(t)e<sup>st</sup>dt

[On the right blackboard there is part of a formula and a diagram with an x-y scale and three other lines touching down to the base. Above these lines are some numbers that are partly indecipherable.]

γ<sub>n</sub> = 2<sup>n/12</sup>K

  0 2 <sup>3</sup>

⌊⌊⌊⌊

[Below George and the blackboards is text:]

...but I wanted it to be true so badly that I started believing it myself.
