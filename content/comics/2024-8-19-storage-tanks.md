[Two guards with helmets are standing on scaffolding to the left of two large tanks with labels at the top. The tanks are cylindrical with a smaller base than the tank above it. The left tank has a small sign with unreadable text and near the bottom of the right tank there is a triangular warning sign with an exclamation mark inside it and a line of unreadable text below it. The guard on the left is talking to the other guard. Miss Lenhart is seen running away from the right tank with an electric drill in one hand. There is a hole in the base of the right tank which has caused the liquid inside to leak out of the tank splashing on the ground in the direction of Miss Lenhart.]

Left guard: As head of security, your primary task is to monitor the storage tanks and watch for calculus teachers trying to drill holes in their bases.
