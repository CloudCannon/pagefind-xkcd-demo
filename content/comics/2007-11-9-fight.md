[[Text: We had a fight last night.]]

[[A guy is sitting in a sofa, head in both hands, feeling upset.]]

[[Text: I guess she's still mad.]]

[[A girl is standing with arms crossed in front of her chest, with the same mood.]]

[[Text: I woke up to find she'd written a sappy love note]]

[[The guy is standing in front of a computer, with a cup in his hand.]]

[[Text: to my boot sector.]]

[[The cup now lies on the floor, the guy is looking at the computer with disbelief.]]

Computer: Operating system not found
