[Beret Guy is sitting at a desk, wearing a lab coat. Cueball is walking in from the right as Beret Guy stretches an arm out towards him in greeting.]

Beret Guy: Welcome to the doctor!

Beret Guy: We're like librarians, but for your bones and blood.

[In a frame-less panel Beret Guy is standing in front of Cueball while holding a device in his hand, which are attached with a coiling wire to a thermometer in Cueball's mouth. He reads something of the device while holding a pill bottle in the other hand.]

Beret Guy: Uh-oh! This beeper says you're too hot.

Beret Guy: You should eat some of these little snacks that make you colder.

[Zoom in on the two persons where Beret Guy is holding a pen up towards Cueball who is holding a clipboard with a newspaper page stuck to it. Cueball is looking down at the page, which has a black picture in the top left corner and lots of unreadable lines across the rest of the page.]

Beret Guy: We can make holes in you, but you have to fill out this form first.

Cueball: This is a New York Times crossword.

Beret Guy: Don't worry, it's a Monday, so it's not too hard.

[Cueball is watching as Beret Guy drags in a machine labeled "MRI" on a dolly.]

Cueball: This ***is*** a doctor's office, right?

Beret Guy: Yeah! It used to be my house, but I found the setting on Google Maps to change it.

Beret Guy: Hey, wanna help find out what this box does? I bet it's loud!
