  The flags were probably vaporized on impact, because we launched it before we had finished figuring out how to land. That makes sense from an engineering standpoint, but also feels like a metaphor.

[Cueball is standing behind while Megan sits at a laptop.]

Megan: Huh. *Luna 2*, the first artificial object to touch another world, carried a sphere made of steel Soviet flag emblems.

[A patterned sphere is shown blowing up to pieces.]

It was designed to blow apart on impact, scattering tiny metal flags and ribbons across the surface of the moon.

[Close-up of Cueball and Megan's faces.]

Cueball: So the first physical contact humans had with a heavenly body...

Megan: ...was throwing a shrapnel grenade full of flags at it.

Cueball: Well, it's on-brand for us, at least.
