[[A woman is talking on the phone, holding a cup]]

Phone: Hi, this is your son's school. We're having some computer trouble.

Mom: Oh dearâdid he break something?

Phone: In a wayâ

Phone: Did you really name your son "Robert'); DROP TABLE Students;--" ?

Mom: Oh, yes. Little Bobby Tables, we call him.

Phone: Well, we've lost this year's student records. I hope you're happy.

Mom: And I hope you've learned to sanitize your database inputs.
