  "Even the blind—those who are anxious to hear, but are not able to see—will be taken care of. Immense megaphones have been constructed and will be in use at The Tribune office and in the Coliseum. The one at the Coliseum will be operated by a gentleman who draws $60 a week from Barnum & Bailey's circus for the use of his voice."

[Megan and Cueball face each other while talking on the left of the panel]

Megan: Ugh, I'm just going to hide out for election night. We'll know the results the next day anyway. The drama is so unnecessary.

Cueball: Yeah. The internet and the 24-hour news have turned elections into a continuous, inescapable media onslaught.

[A man in a top hat appears on the right side of the panel with a "Poof"]

[Panel with just the man in a top hat, holding a newspaper]

Man in a top hat: Hi! I'm a time traveler from 1896. Let me tell you about our election night coverage.

Man in a top hat: *Ahem*

Man in a top hat: From the Chicago Tribune

[Zoom in on the head of the man in a top hat]

Man in a top hat: "Once every hour from the roof of the Great Northern Hotel a series of bombs, which will ascend for several thousand feet, will be fired. Two colors will be used, blue and red."

Man in a top hat: "Blue to indicate McKinley's election, red to indicate Bryan's election."

Man in a top hat: "The bombardment of the skies will commence at 7 o'clock and will be repeated hourly."

[Grey citation]: Chicago Tribune, Oct 30th & Nov 1st, 1896

[Megan and Cueball on the left looking at the man in the top hat on the right]

Megan: Yeah, well, we have a needle, though.

Man in a top hat: A needle.

Megan: It jiggles!

Man in a top hat: Sounds awful.

Cueball: Listen, you had to be there.
