[tall slide, seen from the ground]

When I was a kid, my school playground had a really tall slide that always made me nervous

[tall slide, seen from the side]

We moved away, but the slide stuck in my memory, becoming a skyscraping monster

[car and a sign pointing to school zone]

Years later, I was passing through my old town and remembered the playground

I drove to the school to see the slide that my inner six-year-old thought was so towering

[huge slide, (small) person beside it]

AND IT WAS HUGE

I KNEW IT
