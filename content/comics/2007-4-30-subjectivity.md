[A tall slide, seen from the ground.]

When I was a kid, my school playground had a really tall slide that always made me nervous.

[A tall slide, seen from the side.]

We moved away, but the slide stuck in my memory, becoming a skyscraping monster.

[A car and a sign pointing to school zone.]

Years later, I was passing through my old town and remembered the playground.

I drove to the school to see the slide that my inner six-year-old thought was so towering.

[A huge slide, Cueball beside it.]

AND IT <u>WAS</u> HUGE!

I <u>KNEW</u> IT!
