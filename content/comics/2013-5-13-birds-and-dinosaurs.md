  Sure, T. rex is closer in height to Stegosaurus than a sparrow. But that doesn't tell you much; 'Dinosaur Comics' author Ryan North is closer in height to certain dinosaurs than to the average human.

By any reasonable definition, *T. rex* is more closely related to sparrows than to *Stegosaurus*.

[Diagram showing that *Stegosaurus* came earlier than *T. rex*, along with it showing that *T. rex* came closer in time to sparrows. Evaluation criteria "separation by time", "phylogenetic distance" and "physical similarity" are highlighted in red.]

Birds aren't *descended* from dinosaurs, they *are* dinosaurs.

Which means that the fastest animal alive today is a small carnivorous dinosaur, *Falco peregrinus*.

[A picture of two birds is shown, one large and one small.]

It preys mainly on other dinosaurs, which it strikes and kills in midair with its claws.

[In red:] This is a good world.
