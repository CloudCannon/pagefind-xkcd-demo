[[A standing figure is conversing with another figure who is sitting on computer desk chair. Behind the sitting figure is a desk with a flat-panel monitor.]]

Standing figure: Alice sends a message to Bob saying to meet her somewhere.

Sitting figure: Uh huh.

Standing figure: But Eve sees it, too, and goes to the place.

Sitting figure: With you so far.

Standing figure: Bob is delayed, and Alice and Eve meet.

Sitting figure: Yeah?

I've discovered a way to get computer scientists to listen to any boring story.
