[Black Hat is driving, and Danish, who seems to be his equal, is in the passenger's seat. They are closely followed by some other vehicle.]

Black Hat: That guy's tailgating me.

Danish: I'll take a look.

[A car is shown to be closely behind Black Hat's car.]

Danish: His laptop's running, probably in the back seat. And... yup, the WiFi autoconnects.

[Close-up of Danish using a laptop.]

Danish: Now we just scan for remote exploits... install speech synth... And take a shot in the psychological dark.

[Cueball's car.]

Laptop: Hello.

Cueball: What? Who's there?

Laptop: She'd be alive if it weren't for you.

Cueball: ...Oh God.
