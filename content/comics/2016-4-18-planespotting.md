[[A man sits on a medical examination table. He's wearing a headset with lot of wires attached to it, which lead to a complicated-looking device. A woman's operating the device.]]

Woman: Neural-digital link established. Ready to upload your consciousness to the computer? 

Man: Sure, go for it. 

[[She presses a button. The wires light up; the man looks shocked.]]

<<Bzzzzzzt>>

[[There's no more sparks; the woman taps on the computer's keyboard.]]

Woman: ... hmm. 

Man: What? 

Woman: It's not responding - the whole system is frozen. I think the transfer failed.

Man: No, that sounds right.
