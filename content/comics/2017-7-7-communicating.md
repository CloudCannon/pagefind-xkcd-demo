[Egg-shaped character Humpty Dumpty, drawn with an angry face, is sitting on a brick wall and facing Alice, depicted as Science Girl.]

Humpty Dumpty: When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean. Neither more nor less.

Alice: I wonder what all those words you just said meant. Maybe you're telling me I can have all your stuff!

Humpty Dumpty: What!? No!

Alice: Your car, too? Gosh, thanks!
