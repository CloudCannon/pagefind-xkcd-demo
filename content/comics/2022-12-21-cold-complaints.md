[Hairy sitting on a chair in front of a computer screen, with unkempt hair, and a line of figurative bubbles emerge from the back of his head to indicate a muzzy feeling in his head. There is an image of Ponytail on the screen, speaking.]

Ponytail: Well, it's not COVID or flu. Probably one of the other viruses.

Hairy: Ughh

[A zoomed out version of the image, Ponytail cannot be seen]

Ponytail: There's not much you can do to speed up recovery other than rest, hydrate, and whine and complain and be a gigantic baby about it.

[Same as previous panel]

Hairy: Whine and complain?

Ponytail: Yeah. You need to act like you're the first person ever to have a cold.

[Hairy lying on a couch wrapped in a blanket, with a lot of paper tissues around]

Off-screen voice: Are you ***sure*** that's what she said?

Hairy: Unbelievable. Here I am, the only person ever to feel bad, and you're ***doubting*** me?
