[Black Hat is going through a door, an almost-empty bottle in his hand. A voice speaks to him from off panel.]

Cueball: Seriously? This thing runs *Java?* It's single-purpose hardware!

[Cueball is sitting at a computer, holding some device which is wired to a box, and pointing at the screen.]

Cueball: I bet they actually hired someone to spend six months porting this JVM so they could write their 20 lines of code in a familiar setting.

[Black Hat has a pair of bolt cutters in his hand that had been obscured in the first panel.]

Black Hat: Well, you know what they sayâ€” When all you have is a pair of bolt cutters and a bottle of vodka, everything looks like the lock on the door of Wolf Blitzer's boathouse.

Cueball: I'm glad *you *had a nice night.
