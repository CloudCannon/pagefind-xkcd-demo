  I don't understand the things you do, and you therefore may represent an interaction with the quantum vacuum virtual plasma.

[[Two figures are walking along, chatting.]]

Figure: Hear about that "impossible" microwave thruster? 

[[The figures stop walking and look at each other.]]

Woman: Yeah. Let me get this straight - they pumped 20 kilowatts into a box under ambient conditions... and it only twitched a *little*?

Figure: Yeah. 

[[The figures continue walking. We see them in silhouette.]]

Woman: *That's* surprising. If you umped 20 kilowatts into *me*, I'd twitch a *lot*. 

Figure: But you're not pushing on the quantum vacuum.

Woman: I *might* be. I do a lot of things. 

Figure: I guess we can't be sure.
