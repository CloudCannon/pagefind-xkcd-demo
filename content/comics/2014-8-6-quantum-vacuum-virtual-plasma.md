  I don't understand the things you do, and you therefore may represent an interaction with the quantum vacuum virtual plasma.

[Cueball and Megan are walking together in the foreground.]

Cueball: Hear about that "impossible" microwave thruster?

[They stop walking and Cueball turns to face Megan.]

Megan: Yeah. Let me get this straight â€” they pumped 20 kilowatts into a box under ambient conditions

...and it only twitched a *little*?

Cueball: Yeah.

[Zoomed out - they are seen in silhouette walking together again.]

Megan: *That's* surprising. If you pumped 20 kilowatts into *me*, I'd twitch a *lot*.

Cueball: But you're not pushing on the quantum vacuum.

Megan: I *might* be. I do a lot of things.

Cueball: I guess we can't be sure.
