  I spent more time trying to get an audible.com audio book playing than it took to listen to the book.  I have lost every other piece of DRM-locked music I have paid for.

Thinking of buying from audible.com or iTunes?

Remember, if you pirate something, it's yours for life.  You can take it anywhere and it will always work.

[[There is a flowchart whose paths are (You're a Criminal)<-Pirate<-(Buy or Pirate)->Buy->(Things Change)->(You Try to Recover Your Collection)->(You're a Criminal)]]

But if you buy DRM-locked media, and you ever switch operating systems or new technology comes along, your collection could be lost.

And if you try to keep it, you'll be a criminal (DMCA 1201).

So remember: if you want a collection you can count on, PIRATE IT.

Hey, you'll be a criminal either way.

(If you don't like this, demand DRM-free files)
