  I spent more time trying to get an audible.com audiobook playing than it took to listen to the book. I have lost every other piece of DRM-locked music that I ever paid for.

Black Hat: Thinking of buying from audible.com or iTunes?

Black Hat: Remember, if you pirate something, it's yours for life.  You can take it anywhere and it will always work.

[There is a flowchart whose paths are (You're a Criminal)<-Pirate<-(Buy or Pirate)->Buy->(Things Change)->(You Try to Recover Your Collection)->(You're a Criminal)]

Black Hat: But if you buy DRM-locked media, and you ever switch operating systems or new technology comes along, your collection could be lost.

Black Hat: And if you try to keep it, you'll be a criminal ([DMCA 1201](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1201)).

Black Hat: So remember: if you want a collection you can count on, PIRATE IT.

Black Hat: Hey, you'll be a criminal either way.

(If you don't like this, demand DRM-free files)
