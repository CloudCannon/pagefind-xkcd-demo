[Cueball showing Ponytail his laptop.]

Cueball: Keep in mind that I'm self-taught, so my code may be a little messy.

Ponytail: Lemme see - I'm sure it's fine.

[Ponytail sits at desk, Cueball stand behind her.]

Ponytail: ...Wow. This is like being in a house built by a child using nothing but a hatchet and a picture of a house.

[Same scene.]

Ponytail: It's like a salad recipe written by a corporate lawyer using a phone autocorrect that only knew Excel formulas.

[Same scene.]

Ponytail: It's like someone took a transcript of a couple arguing at IKEA and made random edits until it compiled without errors.

Cueball: ***Okay,*** I'll read a style guide.
