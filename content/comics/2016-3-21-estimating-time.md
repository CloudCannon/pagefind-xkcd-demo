[Ponytail is sitting back from her a laptop lifting her hands of the keyboard, having presumably just paused work on a project.]

Ponytail: Aaaa! I'm so bad at estimating how long projects will take.

[Danish walks into the panel towards Ponytail who seems to relax back against the chair.]

Danish: Don't panic-there's a simple trick for that:

Danish:  Take your most realistic estimate and double it.

Ponytail: Okay, but-

[A frameless panel with only Danish holding a hand up.]

Danish: Now double it again. Add five minutes.

Danish: Double it a third time.

Ponytail (from off panel): Okay...

[Danish raises her arms above her head in mock hysteria. Ponytail runs away from her desk screaming.]

Danish: 30 seconds have gone by and you've done nothing but double imaginary numbers! You're making no progress and will never finish!

Ponytail: <big>*Aaaaaa!*</big>

Danish: *Paaaniic!*

Ponytail: <big>*Aaaaaaa!*</big>
