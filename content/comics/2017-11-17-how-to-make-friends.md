[First panel with words, with the words in the center white and on a black oval background, which is in turn on the white background:]

*Presenting:*

How to make friends

[Second panel with Cueball and Hairy facing each other:]

Cueball: Want to go eat food together?

Cueball: We could also sit together and talk without eating. I don't need to eat. I mean, I do need to eat. But if you don't want to eat then we can just talk. I can eat later.

[Third panel with words, same format as first panel:]

*Okay*

It turns out I still haven't figured out how to do this.

*Sorry*
