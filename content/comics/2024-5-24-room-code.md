[Megan is standing next to Cueball, who is holding a phone or a note in his hand. Each one has a suitcase on the out-facing side of them.]

Cueball: Okay, I need to remember that the room code is 020518.

[Closeup on Megan who has her palm raised.]

Megan: Easy -- just memorize it as "the first three prime numbers, if you realized you couldn't remember what came after 2 and started to panic and get them increasingly wrong."

[Beat panel of Megan and Cueball standing with no border.]

[Megan and Cueball still standing.]

Megan: ...Are you mad because that actually works?

Cueball: ***Why is memory like this?***
