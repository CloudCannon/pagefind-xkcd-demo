[[Two people walk toward a large control panel.]]

Person 1: Over here we have the Universe Control Panel. These dials, for example, control Christmas.

[[A close-up on a dial. It is labeled "Santa enters houses through..." and has the following settings: chimney, open window, kitchen faucet, cat flap, toilet, shower drain, mail slot, heating vents, bathroom mirror, pores of your skin.]]

[[The second person trips.]]

Person 2: Whoops!

<<trip>>

[[They catch themselves on a dial, accidentally moving it.]]

<<click click>>

[[Person 2 stares at the dial.]]

Person 2: What was the Santa dial set to before?

Person 1: I forget.

Person 2: I'll just guess.
