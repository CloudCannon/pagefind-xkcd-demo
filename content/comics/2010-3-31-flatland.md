[Cueball talks to a square on the ground.]

Cueball: Hey, A. Square. How's Flatland?

A. Square: Still flat. What's up?

Cueball: I just spent an hour playing a demo of this 4D game called Miegakure.

[In a frameless panel, a character in Miegakure jumps around the 4D landscape.]

Caption above the panel: Trying to jump from block to block in four dimensions hurt my brain.

[Cueball continues talking to A. Square on the ground.]

Cueball: So I apologize for giving you a hard time when you were slow to understand 3D space. I sympathize now.

A. Square: It's okay.

[Zoom in on Cueball's head]

Cueball: Also, I apologize for drawing arms, legs, and eyes on you to make you look like SpongeBob. That was out of line.

A. Square: Yes, it was.
