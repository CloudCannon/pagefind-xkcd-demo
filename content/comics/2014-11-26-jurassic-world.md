[[White Hat guy and another person are walking along.]]

WH: In 

Jurassic World

, we've used genetic engineering to invent a 

better

 Dinosaur.

OP: Tyrannosaurus is the most charismatic animal that ever lived, and you think you'll 

upstage

 it?

[[They continue to walk along.]]

WH: 

Tyrannosaurus

 was cool, but it's two decades old!

OP: I think it's a 

little

 older than that.

[[As they walk along, White Hat points up at something in front of them.]]

WH: We took 

Tyrannosaurus

 and we 

improved

 it. Made it scarier, deadlier, smarter. == Look- there it is!

[[The pair are dwarfed in comparison to the T-Rex from Dinosaur Comics.]]
