  20 balloons float away while I'm busy permanently tying one to a tree to deal with it for good. Unfortunately, that one balloon was 'land a rocket on the moon in Kerbal Space Program.'

[Cueball is holding a balloon with "Math Problem" written on it. He is running to grab a balloon labeled "Call Mom" that is floating away.]

[Cueball is now holding both balloons, but looks over his shoulder and sees a balloon that reads "Check Oven".]

Cueball: *!!*

[Cueball releases the balloons he had been holding and runs for the third.]

[Cueball jumps for the "Check Oven" balloon and snatches it just before it is out of reach.]

*LEAP*

Cueball: Hah!
