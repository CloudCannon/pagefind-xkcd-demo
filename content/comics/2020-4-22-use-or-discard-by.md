[Megan stands in the middle of the panel, holding two flare guns, one in each hand.]

Megan: These emergency flare guns are about to expire.

Cueball [off-panel]: I forgot we had those.

[Cueball sitting at a desk, working on a computer.]

Megan [off-panel]: This one says "Use or discard by Apr 25 2020."

Cueball: Okay...

[Megan holds up one of the flare guns looking at it. She holds the other flare gun by her side.]

Megan: But ***this*** one just says "Use by" ...

Cueball [off-panel]: ***No.***
