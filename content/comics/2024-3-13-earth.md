  Just think of all the countless petty squabbles and misunderstandings, of all the fervent hatreds, over so insignificant a thing as the direction and duration of a rocket engine firing.

[Carl Sagan (drawn Cueball like but with flat hair) is standing in front of a black screen with a tiny pale blue dot in the middle. He indicates the screen by holding out his right hand palm up towards the screen. He is speaking to someone off-panel, who replies from a star burst on the right edge of the panel.]

Carl: Look again at that dot. That's home. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives...

Carl: On a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

Off-panel voice: We ***know,*** Carl.

[Caption below the panel:]

Carl Sagan was ***not*** making us feel better about how badly he'd messed up the low Earth orbit reentry burn.
