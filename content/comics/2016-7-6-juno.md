[At a NASA press conference Blondie stands behind a lectern with the NASA logo. To the left is Megan and to the right is Cueball, both looking towards Blondie.]

Blondie: After traveling 1.7 billion miles, the Juno spacecraft reached Jupiter within one second of its scheduled arrival time.

Off-panel voice: Very impressive!

Blondie: Thank you.

[All three look straight out as Megan comments on the praise.]

Megan: I mean, we were aiming for Saturn. Still, nailed the time.

Blondie: Shhhh.
