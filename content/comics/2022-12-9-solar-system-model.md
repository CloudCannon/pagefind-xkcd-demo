[Miss Lenhart is teaching a class. In front of her sits a student with curly hair at his desk pen ready on the paper to write notes. The front of the next table behind him can be seen. Behind Lenhart is a white board with two drawings and a large underlined header at the top. The drawing beneath the header shows a solar system with a radiating sun and two planets orbiting with the orbits shown and the planets marked with small circles, one on either side of the sun, both above the sun. Beneath this is another sun in the middle of either a group of four eight-like shapes, or a diagram similar to the usual depiction of the {{w|Atomic\_orbital#Orbitals\_table|*4f<sub>xyz</sub>* or *4f<sub>zx<sup>2</sup> - zy<sup>2</sup></sub>* orbitals}}. Lenhart points at the board with a pointing stick while looking out over the class.]

Miss Lenhart: Early 20<sup>th</sup> century models of the solar system imagined that planets circled the Sun like electrons in an atom.

Miss Lenhart: We now know planets have no precise location, but instead occupy probabilistic *orbitals*...
