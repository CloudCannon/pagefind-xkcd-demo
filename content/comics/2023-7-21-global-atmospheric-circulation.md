[Beret Guy, holding a basketball and a helium balloon, is talking to Cueball. There is a basketball hoop at the right of the panel.]

Beret Guy: Check out my global atmospheric circulation trick shot!

[Beret Guy continues to hold the basketball as he and his balloon rise from the ground and Cueball looks at him.]

[Beret Guy holding the balloon rises higher and floats toward the left as Cueball continues to look at him.]

[Cueball is alone. The basketball hoop is again shown at the right of the panel.]

[Cueball is alone. The basketball hoop is again shown at the right of the panel.]

[Again, nobody is present. The basketball hoop is at the right of the panel.]

[The basketball hoop is at the right of the panel. Beret Guy, seen from a distance even further in the background and higher, floats toward the left with his balloon.]

[Again, nobody is present. The basketball hoop is at the right of the panel.]
