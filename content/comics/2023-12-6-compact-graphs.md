[Left: graph of points plotted along two axes, headered by:]

Variable 1: X Axis

Variable 2: Y Axis

[An arrow pointing to the right.]

[Right: various semi-transparent numbers in different colors stacked on top of each other, headered by:]

Variable 1: Hue

Variable 2: Label

[Caption below the panel:]

Design tip: You can make your graphs more space-efficient by using hue and label for the first two variables, instead of only turning to them once youâ€™ve used up the X and Y axes.
