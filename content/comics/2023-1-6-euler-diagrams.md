[Cueball is standing in front of a whiteboard with both arms raised holding his palms up towards and unseen audience. A person from the audience talks to him from off-panel. The whiteboard shows an Euler diagram with two large circles overlapping in the middle and a third smaller circle overlapping only the top right part of the right circle. There are lots of illegible text on the board. Three lines of text are in the left circle only, one line is in the shared part of the two circles, two in the bottom part of the right circle, two lines in the overlap with the small circle and one line only in the small third circle. Above the circles are two more lines of illegible text and above those a large heading and one readable word below that, just above the first illegible text:]

Venn Diagram

Off-panel voice: Actually, that's an *Euler* diagram, because-

Cueball: Come ***onnnn.***

Cueball: ***Everything*** is named after Euler. Euler's constant, Euler's function.

Cueball: Can't we let John Venn have this?

Off-panel voice: No.

Off-panel voice: Also, numbers are now "Euler letters."
