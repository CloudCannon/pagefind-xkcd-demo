  The same goes for the one where you're wrestling the Green Ranger in the swimming pool full of Crisco. You guys all have that dream, right? It's not just me. Right?

[Megan as a teacher speaks to a crowded classroom, where all students are grayed out except one of the Cueball students who is drawn in the normal black line.]

Megan: Your projects are due today by 5:00 PM.

Cueball (thinking): ...I didn't even know we had one.

[Zoom in on Cueball at his small desk still thinking. No other students are visible, but the desk next to his is shown although also fading out.]

Cueball (thinking): Wait. I don't think I've been attending. I must have forgotten I had this class. Shitshitshit.

[Cueball is sitting at his desk, but now seen from the side, looking from the edge of his desk. The very right part of the drawing, with Cueball's back and chair, now begins to fade.]

Cueball (thinking): Okay, I'm gonna fail. Will it hold me back? I just want to get out of here. I thought I had *finished* my requirements already.

[Cueball takes his hand to his face. This panel fades so much it is only about half a panel. Even the frame around the panel disappears.]

Cueball (thinking): In fact, I think I remember graduating. What the hell isâ€”

[As the previous scene completely fades we find Cueball waking up in his bed with small blobs above his head to indicate the dream disappearing.]

Fun Fact: Decades from now, with school a distant

memory, you'll <u>still</u> be having this dream.
