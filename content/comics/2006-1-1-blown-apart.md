[A black number 70 sees a red package with the appearance of a Christmas present. This small panel is partly overlaid on the next larger panel, which is shifted down.]

**70**

70: hey, a package!

[The package explodes in a cloud of brown smoke. This panel is both behind the first in the top left corner, and below the last panel, which has been laid on top of that corner.]

**BOOM**

[There are a red 7, a green 5, and a blue 2 lying near a scorched mark on the floor.]
