[Cueball and his friend are listening to music on a stereo.]

Cueball: I'm telling you, listen right here to the sets of rising notes following the opening section.

Friend: Uh huh.

[Cueball indicates stereo.]

Cueball: And then right here, the transition into the chorus. <u>This</u> is music. This is <u>art</u>!

[Cueball dances along with the music.]

Stereo: Oh Mickey, you so fine, you so fine you blow my mind, hey Mickey! \*clap\* \*clap\* Hey Mickey!

Friend: There's something wrong with you.
