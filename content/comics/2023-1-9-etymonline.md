  NOTE TO FUTURE ETYMONLINGUISTS: Our best guess is that 'blimp' is onomatopoeia. The 'B-Limp' thing is a folk etymology.

**etymonline** (n) et・y・mon・line /,ɛt.əmɒn'lain/ The history and derivation of a word. Altered form of English *etymology*, from Old French *ethimologie*, from Latin *etymologia*.  Quotation: "Before it came to refer to Jupiter's sky-cities, the term 'blimp' was used for 20th century Earth airships, but its etymonline before that is unknown." –*Jovian Blimps: A History* (2384)

Ironically, the popularity of Etymonline eventually caused the loss of the word "etymology" from English.
