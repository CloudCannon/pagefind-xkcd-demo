  "Symbolic integration" is when you theatrically go through the motions of finding integrals, but the actual result you get doesn't matter because it's purely symbolic.

[Two flow charts are shown.]

[The first flow chart has four steps in simple order, one with multiple recommendations.]

DIFFERENTIATION

Start

Try applying

Chain Rule

Power Rule

Quotient Rule

Product Rule

Etc.

Done?

No [Arrow returns to "Try applying" step.]

Yes

Done!

[The second flow chart begins like the first, then descends into chaos.]

INTEGRATION

Start

Try applying

Integration by Parts

Substitution

Done?

Haha, Nope!

[Chaos, Roughly from left to right, top to bottom, direction arrows not included.]

Cauchy's Formula

????

???!?

???

???

?

Partial Fractions

??

?

Install Mathematica

?

Riemann Integration

Stokes' Theorem

???

?

Risch Algorithm

???

[Sad face.]

?????

???

What the heck is a Bessel Function??

Phone calls to mathematicians

Oh No

Burn the Evidence

[More arrows pointing out of the image to suggest more steps.]
