[[Character sits alone at a desk.. drifting in an infinite white void..]]

Character, thinking: I've been posting my public key for fifteen years now, but no one has ever asked me for it or used it for anything as far as I can tell.

[[A frame of silence.]]

[[Another frame of silence.]]

Character, thinking more: Maybe I should try posting my PRIVATE key instead.
