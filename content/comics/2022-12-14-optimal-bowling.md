  If you want to bowl a strike, the optimal place is almost certainly inside a bowling alley, although with a little luck any establishment uphill from one could also work.

Data for Optimal Bowling

[Four line graphs are depicted. Each has a numbered one-word general description in a box at the top, an unlabeled y-axis, and a labeled x-axis. The relevant curve and other comments on each graph are in red.]

1. Aim

[The graph's x-axis is labeled from -180° to 180°.]

Release Direction

[The red curve on the graph is just above the x-axis at all points except for a steep peak around 0°. The red curve is labeled:]

Relative Probability of Strike

2. Speed

[The graph's x-axis is labeled from 10<sup>-1</sup> to 10<sup>8</sup>, with the last point on the x-axis labeled "Speed of Light".]

Ball Speed (m/s)

[The red curve on the graph starts at the x-axis for 10<sup>-1</sup>, reaches its peak around 10, then declines and becomes a dashed line ending around three-quarters of the peak around 10<sup>2</sup>. The remainder of the curve is replaced by two labels:]

Equipment Damage [from approximately 10<sup>2</sup> to approximately 10<sup>5</sup>]

Widespread Destruction [from approximately 10<sup>5</sup> to the end of the axis]

3. Spin

[The graph's x-axis is labeled from 0 to 10<sup>12</sup>.]

Spin (RPMs)

[The red curve on the graph starts about halfway from its peak for 0, reaches its peak somewhere between 0 and 1,000, then declines and becomes a dashed line around 1,000, soon after which the remainder of the curve is replaced by two labels:]

Ball Explodes [from approximately 10,000 to approximately 10<sup>7.5</sup>]

Widespread Destruction [from approximately 10<sup>7.5</sup> to the end of the axis]

4. Weight

[The graph's x-axis is labeled from 10<sup>0</sup> to 10<sup>40</sup>.]

Ball Mass (kg)

[The red curve on the graph starts just above the x-axis for 10<sup>0</sup>, rises steeply and drops steeply ending just above the x-axis, then becoming a dashed line, all before reaching 10<sup>10</sup>. The remainder of the curve is replaced by two labels:]

Equipment Damage [from approximately 10<sup>9</sup> to approximately 10<sup>22</sup>]

Black Hole Created  [from approximately 10<sup>25</sup> to the end of the axis]
