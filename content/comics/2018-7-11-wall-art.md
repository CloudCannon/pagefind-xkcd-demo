  At first, I moved from pokémon posters to regular oil paintings, but then these really grumpy and unreasonable detectives from the Louvre showed up and took them all. They wouldn't even give me back my thumbtacks!

[White Hat and Cueball are standing together and looking at eleven framed pictures on a wall.]

Cueball: Getting older is so weird. 20 years ago, I thought thumbtacked Pokémon posters made my wall look so cool.

[Cueball has his hands raised up in a close-up.]

Cueball: But these days I feel this compulsion to get framed oil paintings and spend hours carefully arranging them.

[Return to the setting in the first frame.]

White Hat: These are all oil paintings of Pokémon.

Cueball: Look, I’m meeting maturity halfway.
