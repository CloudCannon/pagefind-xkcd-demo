  When I was a kid, I asked my parents why our houses didn't have toothpaste pipes in addition to water ones. I'm strangely pleased to see Amazon thinking the same way.

Now that Amazon is advertising one-hour delivery of bottled water,

[[A diagram showing the most obvious progression of events.  First just one bottle is sent from the warehouse to a person.  Then two.  Then five.  Then 20.

Finally, a direct pipe sends the water along.]]

I vote we start calling municipal plumbing "on-demand hyperloop-style water delivery" and see if we can sell anyone on the idea.
