[Megan and Black Hat are talking, Megan is sitting at a computer.]

Black Hat: I've discovered something.

Megan: Oh?

Black Hat: Standard server rack units and standard beehive honeycomb frames are compatible.

Black Hat: They're both 19 inches, with similar pitches.

Megan: Uh oh.

Black Hat: I'm pleased to announce that today, for a few hours, Google led the world in datacenter honey production.

Black Hat: Until their security people kicked me out.

Megan: I'm sorry your beekeeping career ended so quickly.

Black Hat: I'll find a new datacenter.

Black Hat: Turns out most colocation TOSes don't mention beehives.

Megan: I suspect that will soon change.
