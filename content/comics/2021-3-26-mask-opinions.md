[Cueball and White Hat are standing and talking. Both are wearing masks.]

Cueball: I am so excited not to have so many opinions about different kinds of masks at the forefront of my brain at all times.

White Hat: Seriously.

[The panel is zoomed in on Cueball's upper body. His hands are raised.]

Cueball: "Do you know any tricks for getting a good seal around the bridge of your nose?"

Cueball: I ***do,*** and I want to ***stop*** knowing them.

[Cueball is walking away from White Hat with his hands raised above his head.]

White Hat: You could always try talking about something else.

Cueball: ***Honestly not sure I can!***

White Hat: Well.

White Hat: Soon.
