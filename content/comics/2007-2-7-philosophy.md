[[Girl sits on chair, thinking]]

[[Two panels pass, the girl does not move]]

Girl: If the question of what it all means doesn't mean anything, why do I keep coming back to it?

[[Two boys are talking to each other]]

First boy: She's getting existential again.

Second boy: It's okay, I have a super soaker.

[[Second boy pulls a large super soaker from a drawer]]
