Cueball: It's the thigh of the tiger

[Cueball continues to sing, titling his head upwards.]

Cueball: When the moon hits your thigh like a big pizza pie, that's amore.

[Cueball sings on now holding the microphone in both hands.]

Cueball: She's my brown-thighed girl.

Megan: Don't you have a job or something?

Megan: Also, Eww.
