[Darth Vader is holding up what appears to be the handle of a powered-down lightsaber looking down at it while talking to Luke Skywalker, drawn with thin hair hanging down his forehead.]

Darth Vader: ***I see you have constructed a new lightsaber.***

Luke Skywalker: ...Yes.

Luke Skywalker: That is definitely what I did.
