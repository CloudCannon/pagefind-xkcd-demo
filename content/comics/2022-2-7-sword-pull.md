[Cueball walks towards a large stone on the ground from which the hilt of a sword is protruding. The ground he walks on is uneven, with small plants growing and small stones lying on the ground.]

Cueball: ??

[Cueball stands on the stone and attempts to pull the sword out of the stone using both hands and leaning a bit back away from the sword.]

[Cueball manages to pull the sword partially out of the stone, still using both hands, and now he is almost standing in full height, but still leaning a bit back. Both he and the sword is vibrating from the effort, as indicated by several sets of two lines around the sword and Cueball's arms. The pull gives off a loud sound, and also a buzzing sound comes because of the pull.  And three small lines above the right part of the stone indicated that other sounds are coming from the stone]

Pull: <big><big>*Yank!*</big></big>

Sword: *Zzz<big>z</big>z*

Stone: Put put put

Stone: <small>Brrr</small>rr<big>rr</big>

[Cueball is still holding on to the sword, with the tip still inside the stone. But he is not pulling anymore and is now looking down on the stone beneath him. There are now several lines from both sides of the stone indicating noises coming from the stone, which now is written on both sides of Cueball on the stone.]

Cueball: ?? ??

Stone:<small>Rr</small>r<big>r<big>rrrrrrrr</big></big>r<small>r</small>

[Cueball has released the sword which has then returned to the original position deep in the stone. The stone is now clearly moving to the right of the panel, with Cueball on top of it. He is looking behind him and holding his arms out to the side to keep his balance. The patch where the stone lay to start is dark. Four large lines behind the stone indicates how it is moving. The stone is already partially outside the right edge of the panel. The sound from the stone is floating behind the stone as it moves to the right]

Stone: <small>R</small>r<small>r</small>r<big>rrrrrr<big>r</big>rr</big>
