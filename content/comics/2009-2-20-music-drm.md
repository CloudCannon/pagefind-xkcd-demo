  Just yesterday I bought my first non-DRM'd songs (The Last Vegas, in keeping with my 'I only listen to things from Guitar Hero' theme).

[Cueball sits at his computer.]

Cueball [typing]: ...and that's why music DRM is bad for listeners *and* artists!

Megan [off-panel]: What are you doing?

[Megan enters and Cueball turns towards her.]

Megan: In case you didn't notice, we *won* the music DRM war.  The big stores are DRM free.

[Zoom in on Megan who holds up a hand doing the sign of the horns.]

Megan: So close the comment thread, get out the debit card, buy us some music, and let's rock the fuck out.

[Back to viewing both as in panel 2.]

Cueball: But I don't actually *like* music, I just like being self-righteous on the web.

Megan: Lucky for you, *that* will always be free.
