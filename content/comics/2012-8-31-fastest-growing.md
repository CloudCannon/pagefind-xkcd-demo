[A man with a combover, a book, and a clipboard approaches Black Hat.]

Combover: You should check us out. We're the fastest-growing religion in the country.

Black Hat: "Fastest-growing" is such a dubious claim.

Combover: It's true! We grew by 85% over the past year.

[In a frameless panel, Black Hat shouts to Rob, out of frame.]

Black Hat: Hey, Rob â€” wanna join my religion?

Rob's off-frame voice: Sure, whatever.

[Black Hat turns back to Combover and produces a notepad and pen.]

Black Hat: Well, looks like my religion grew by 100% this year.

[Black Hat begins to walk away.]

Combover: We have 38,000 members!

Black Hat: Hope they're all ok with second place.
