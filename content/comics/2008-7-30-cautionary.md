  This really is a true story, and she doesn't know I put it in my comic because her wifi hasn't worked for weeks.

Linux: A True Story:

[Cueball talks on a cell phone.]

Week One:

Cousin: Hey, it's your cousin. I got a new computer but don't want Windows. Can you help me install "Linux"?

Cueball: Sure.

[Cueball's cousin sits in an office chair with her laptop on her lap. She is on the phone.]

Week Two:

Cousin: It says my XORG is broken. What's an "XORG"? Where can I look that up?

Cueball: Hmm, lemme show you man pages.

[Cueball's cousin crouches on the floor with the laptop on her lap. She is still on the phone.]

Week Six:

Cousin: Due to auto-config issues, I'm leaving Ubuntu for Debian.

Cueball: Uh.

Cousin: Or Gentoo.

Cueball: Uh oh.

[Cueball's cousin lies on her stomach with the laptop on the floor. On the floor are several pieces of paper and a book. Cueball stands to her left.]

Week Twelve:

Cueball: You haven't answered your phone in days.

Cousin: Can't sleep. Must compile kernel.

Cueball: I'm too late.

[Box with text:]

Parents: talk to your kids about Linux... Before somebody else does.
