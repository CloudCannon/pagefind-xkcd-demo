  So what do we do when we get to base 10? Do we use A, B, C, etc? No: Numbers larger than about 3.6 million are simply illegal.

Cueball: Small numbers like seven or nineteen shouldn't use big numerals like "7" or "9".

Cueball: I mean, "9" is the biggest numeral we have! It should be reserved for ***big*** numbers.

Cueball: Small numbers should be written with small numerals like "1" or "2".

Cueball: That's why my variable-base system uses...Hey! No, listen!

[Caption under the comic:] Factorial numbers are the number system that sounds most like a prank by someone who's about to be escorted out of the math department by security.
