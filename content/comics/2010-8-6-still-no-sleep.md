[Woozy Cueball walks and speaks.]

Cueball: The sleep deprivation madness worsens.

[Cueball examines his hands.]

Cueball: Things seem unreal. Am I even awake? Maybe I'm dreaming.

[Cueball approaches a tree with a squirrel on it.]

Cueball: I'm pretty sure I'm hallucinating this tree.

[Cueball is now in front of the tree, and the squirrel is on the ground. Cueball has his arms open.]

Cueball: But what if I'm hallucinating that I'm hallucinating, and I'm actually totally sane?

Squirrel: Listen.

Squirrel: I wouldn't worry about that.
