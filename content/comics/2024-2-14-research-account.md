[Cueball sits at a desk, typing at his laptop computer.]

[Above him, there is a box indicating his computer screen.]

[Caption above screen:] Application for research account

[Under the caption, there is a panel, representing the computer screen; in the panel: (cut off from above) "Institution: Other/none", where the option has been selected from a drop-down menu. Under that is written "Reason for requesting access to our datasets:", under which is a comment field where "To win an argument with someone in a group chat" has been written. Under that, two long bubbles containing the words "Select all" and "Delete" separate another panel, with a panel featuring the comment field with "Independent research" written. The cursor can still be seen blinking.]

[Caption below the comic panel:]

I never know how honest to be on these forms.
