[Cueball is standing halfway up a stepladder, with his back to the ladder, on the top of a building. He is leaning over a tall device on a pole with a large rectangular box with a stripe. On top is an anemometer, which he is spinning quickly. Behind him, there is a hatch leading out onto the roof with a small antenna, and two boxy roof vents facing towards him.]

*SPIN SPIN SPIN*

[In the lower-right corner of the panel, a medium sized circle shows a different scene. An array of computers are shown on server racks, connected to each other by cables. A sound is coming from one of the computers:]

*WHEEE!*

[Caption below the panel:]

Whenever I see one of those little weather stations, I have to fight the urge to climb up and spin the anemometer real fast to make a computer somewhere think it's in a tornado.
