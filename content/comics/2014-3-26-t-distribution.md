[A physical bell-curve-shaped object labeled "Student's t distribution" is resting on a table. Cueball is working with it and a piece of paper.]

Cueball: Hmm

[Cueball looks at the piece of paper.]

Cueball: ...nope.

[Cueball picks up the object and begins to walk off the panel with it.]

[Cueball comes back onto the panel, now carrying an object shaped like a much more complex curve, with many symmetric spikes and dips, labeled "Teacher's t distribution".]
