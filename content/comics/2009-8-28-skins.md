[Cueball is packing luggage.]

Voice: Where are you going?

Cueball: Convention.

Voice: What for?

Cueball: Well, you know furries, right?

Voice: Sure...

[Cueball closes suitcase.]

Cueball: We're furries whose animal identities have a thing for pretending to be humans.

Voice: I see.

[A convention. People sit behind booths in the background.]

Cueball, with glasses and a mug: How's the weather?

Megan: Great! I've been driving my car and having a job all day!

Cueball: Did you meow?

Megan: Not once!
