[Panel showing Ponytail sitting working at some type of console, possibly in her laboratory. Cueball is standing on the other side of the console, facing her.]

Ponytail: Our lab is trying to pick up the spin line of neutral hydrogen. It's the only radiation from the era before the first stars formed.

[Panel showing Ponytail and Cueball. Ponytail has paused working, with one hand raised off the console.]

Ponytail: It was 1.4 GHz at first, but by now it's redshifted to the 100-MHz range.

Cueball: Isn't that also where FM radio broadcasts?

[Frameless panel showing Ponytail and Cueball. Ponytail is pressing a key on the console to enable and disable a live signal from her lab's equipment.]

Ponytail: Yeah. That's the problem. Listen:

Sound of switch on console: *Click*

Audio signal from console: You're tuned to Hot 92.7: the Vibe! Coming up next...

Sound of switch on console: *Click*

[Panel showing Ponytail and Cueball. Ponytail has resumed working at the console, and Cueball has raised a hand to his chin.]

Ponytail: But once this guy stops talking, that Nobel Prize will be ours.

Cueball: Maybe that's not a station â€“ maybe that's just what reionization sounds like.

Ponytail: Reionization plays a lot of Selena Gomez.
