[Beret Guy walks in, followed by Hairy.]

Beret Guy: Welcome to our company! We're headquartered here, in this real building I found!

[Both people sit down at a table. The 'hire' has a tray with food and a beverage. Beret Guy has a bowl. In the adjacent wall, there is a power outlet with a paper label taped to it marked "Soup". A small roll of wire sits next to Beret Guy's chair.]

Hairy: What do you.. *do*?

Beret Guy: We make stuff for phones! Like apps and stickers.

[Beret Guy grabs the roll of wire.]

Beret Guy: We want to hire you to write on our computers. We can offer you a bunch of paychecks! <small>There are ghosts here.</small>

[Beret Guy unrolls the wire and plugs it into the wall.]

Hairy: ...Are you sure this is a company?

Beret Guy: I hope so!

[Soup streams out of the plugged-in wire into Beret Guy's bowl.]
