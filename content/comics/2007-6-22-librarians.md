Megan: We're stopping in Baltimore to visit my family, and that's final.

Cueball: Hey, look, it's a new hardback book!

Megan: You wouldn't.

[Cueball bends the book backwards.]

Book: *crinkle*

[Cueball bends it back further.]

Book: *creak*

Megan: *twitch*

[Cueball bends the book back still further.]

Book: *crack*

Megan: OKAY!

Megan: You win!
