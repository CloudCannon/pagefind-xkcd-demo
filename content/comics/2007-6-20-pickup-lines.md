[A bar. Beret Guy is the bartender, holding a can or mug. On the counter are a bottle and two mugs. In front of the counter are four barstools. Megan is to the left of the second barstool and Cueball is to the right, talking to her.]

Cueball: If I could rearrange the alphabet, I'd put your sister and I together.

[Another bar scene, shown from a different angle, with the bartender at left of panel and two barstools to the right. Cueball, standing, is talking to a different woman seated at the bar. Cueball points toward the front window of the bar.]

Cueball: Is your father a thief? Because that's totally my Jetta you parked outside.

[Another bar scene. A bar with one mug on it, and one barstool, are visible. Cueball stands talking to Ponytail.]

Cueball: You must be tired, 'cause you've been running through my mind all night.

Cueball: Screaming.
