[Cueball looks down at a puddle on the floor and speaks to someone out-of-panel.]

Cueball: Hey, while you're out, can you pick up some spray cleaner that works on cat vomit?

Voice: Can do!

Voice: Bye!

[Cueball extends his arm and faces the leaving person.]

Cueball: ...Wait!

Voice: Yes?

Cueball: Uh. ...You are in my heart always.

Voice: ...?

Sometimes, when people leave, I'm seized by a sudden fear that they'll die while they're out, and I'll never forget the last thing I said to them.
