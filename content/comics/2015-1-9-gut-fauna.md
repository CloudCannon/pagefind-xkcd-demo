[Cueball on an examining table; Ponytail wearing a doctor's coat holding some test results.]

Doctor: I see the problem. Your gut macrobiome is out of balance. One moment.

[Ponytail leaves.]

Cueball: I think you mean ***micro***biome... Right?

[Ponytail returns, slightly disheveled, carrying a momentarily docile live wolf.]

Doctor: No. Here, swallow this.

Cueball: That's a wolf.

Doctor: Do you need a glass of water?
