[[A doctor reading a clipboard consults a patient sitting on an examination table.]]

Doctor: I see the problem. Your gut macrobiome is out of balance.

Doctor: One moment.

[[Doctor walks off-panel]]

Patient: I think you mean MICRObiome.

Patient: ..right?

[[Doctor returns slightly rumpled and carrying a wolf.]]

Doctor: No. Here, swallow this.

Patient: That's a wolf.

Doctor: Do you need a glass of water?
