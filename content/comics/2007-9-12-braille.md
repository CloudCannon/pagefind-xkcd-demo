  The only big difference I've seen is in colors. Where the regular text reads 'press red button', the braille reads 'press two-inch button'.

I learned to read braille a while back, and I've noticed that the messages on signs don't always match the regular text.

[A sign reads "Third Floor Office" with braille print underneath. Cueball is reading the braille.]

Cueball (thinking): s-i-g-h-t-e-d-p-e-o-p-l-e-s-u-c-k ... Hey!
