  That's actually the original Japanese version of A Million Random Digits, which is much better than the American remake the book was based on.

[Black Hat is sitting in an armchair, with the right arm on the armrest and looking at his smartphone held in his left hand, when a voice from behind him (off-panel left) addresses him. It turns out in the next panels that it is Cueball.]

Cueball (off-panel): Your movie folder is so *weird*. Where do you find all this stuff?

Black Hat: Dunno.

Black Hat: Around.

[In an frame-less panel Cueball is seen sitting in an office chair at a desk facing left. He is looking at Black Hat's computer while typing on the keyboard which is on a shelf lower than the regular desk surface. Black Hat replies to his queries from behind him off-panel right.]

Cueball: *Lorem Ipsum: The Movie?*

Cueball: *Titanic XCVIII?*

Black Hat (off-panel): That series gets good when they start hitting the reef created by all the previous wrecks.

[Cueball leans in closer to the screen.]

Cueball: *Debbie Did 9/11?*

Cueball: *Time Jam: A Connecticut Huskie on King Arthur's Court?*

Black Hat (off-panel): Really underrated *Space Jam* sequel.

[Zoom in on the scene so nothing beneath the keyboard is visible. The screen and Cueball's head almost spans the width of the panel.]

Cueball: *Harold and Kumar Go to Howl's Moving Castle?*

Cueball: *A Million Random Digits with 100,000 Normal Deviates?*

Black Hat (off-panel): That's the original-the book was a novelization.

[Back to Black Hat sitting in the chair as in the first panel, but leaning a bit further back and the arm on the armrest has been moved closer to him.]

Cueball (off-panel): *Michael Bay's The Vagina Monologues!?*

Black Hat: It's pretty good, despite all the CGI explosions.
