[[Stick Guy, holding a newspaper, walks up to Black Hat, who is sitting at a desk and facing the other way.]]

SG: Ever heard of the trolley problem?

BH: No. What is it?

[[Close up on Stick Guy.]]

SG: A trolley is barreling towards five helpless people on the tracks. You can pull a lever to direct it onto another track, but-

[[Black Hat turns his wheelie desk chair to face Stick Guy.]]

BH: Can I reach the lever without getting up?

SG: Wait, I'm not-

BH: In this scenario, how busy am I?

[[Stick Guy and Black Hat facing each other.]]

SG: I guess I forgot who I was talking to. 

BH: For a dollar, I'll promise to pull the lever if one of the five people is you.
