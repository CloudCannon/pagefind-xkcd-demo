Cueball: Ever heard of the trolley problem?

Black hat: No. What is it?

Cueball: A trolley is barreling towards five helpless people on the tracks. You can pull a lever to direct it onto another track, but-

Black hat: Can I reach the lever without getting up?

Cueball: Wait, I'm not-

Black hat: In this scenario, how busy am I?

Cueball: I guess I forgot who I was talking to.

Black hat: For a dollar, I'll promise to pull the lever if one of the five people is you.
