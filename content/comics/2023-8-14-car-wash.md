[Ponytail looks enthused, whilst talking to Cueball]

Ponytail: Seriously? How do you not like car washes?

Ponytail: *Everyone* likes car washes!

[Close-up on Cueball alone]

Cueball: Sure, I love being trapped in a dark shaking glass box that a huge loud robot is licking.

[Ponytail looks less enthused, once more in a full view of them both]

Ponytail: Great, now I don't like car washes either.

Cueball: *Vroom vroom!*

Cueball: *Slurp!*
