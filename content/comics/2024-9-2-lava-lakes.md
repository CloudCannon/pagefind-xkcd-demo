[Megan and Black Hat are talking, with Megan holding up one hand towards Black Hat]

Megan: People think volcano craters are full of lava, but thatâ€™s rare. There are only five or so lava lakes in the world right now.

[Black Hat puts one hand up to his chin]

Black Hat: Interesting.

[Black Hat walks out of frame off to the right]

[Megan stands while three distinct off-panel sound effects come from the right]

<i>Rumble</i>

<small>Crash</small>

<strong>BOOOOM</strong>

[Black Hat walks back into frame]

Megan: What did you&mdash;

Black Hat: There are six now.

Off-panel voice to the right: <i>Why is the golf course erupting!?</i>
