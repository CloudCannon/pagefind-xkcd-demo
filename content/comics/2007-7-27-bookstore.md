[Cueball is standing in a bookstore, looking at a book.]

Cueball [thinking]: This book looks interesting. Maybe I'll buy it.

[Cueball reads the book; a clock appears above.]

Cueball [thinking]: Oops, I read the whole thing.

Cueball [thinking]: I'll just quietly put it back and go.

[Cueball walks through a security scanner to exit the bookstore.]

*BEEP BEEP BEEP*

Voice from off-frame: Hey! Your brain set off the sensor!

Cueball: I, uhh...

Voice from off-frame: You have a book in there, don't you!

Cueball: Crap.
