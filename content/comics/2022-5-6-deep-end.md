How deep ends form in pools

[On the left of the image is the shallowest water in the pool, about the height of Megan. All the water in the image is grey. She is swimming in the water, and a duck floatie and a beach ball are floating to the left of her. It is labeled]

Shallow End

[Underneath, a thick layer is labeled]

Pool Floor

[Going to the right from there, the pool floor begins to curve downwards. As the floor goes down, the water gets deeper. In the deepest area, it is labeled]

Deep End

[At the bottom of the deep end, there is a curve and a deposit on the pool floor. Within the sediment and pool floor, there are some small pools of trapped water, labeled with three arrows]

Trapped Water

[On the pool floor an arrow indicates that the oceanic plate is moving left-to-right across the image, which is labeled]

Subduction

[Some of the water pools are dragged along by the pool floor, while others float up through the ground. The latter are accompanied by several arrows pointing up to indicate upwards movement. These are labeled:] Upward Migration

[At the surface there is an area, which is labeled]

Splash zone

[The water erupts in two geysers, the left slightly larger than the other. Several children (small versions of Ponytail, Hairy, and Jill as herself) are playing there. Jill is sitting with her arms in the air facing the geysers, and Ponytail and Hairy are running towards the right geyser, Hairy with his arms in the air. The area is labeled]

Splash Zone

[To the left of the splash zone is the edge of the pool, where a Cueball figure is in mid-air after jumping off the diving board, with his arms outstretched. This is labeled]
