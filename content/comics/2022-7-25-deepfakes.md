  If so great a deductive mind as Arthur Conan Doyle can be fooled by the Cottingley Deepfakes, what chance do we mortals have? Soon our very reality will be dictated by the whims of Frances (9) and Elsie (16).

[White Hat and Cueball are walking to the right.]

White Hat: Thanks to deepfakes, soon we won't know what's real anymore. Video will become meaningless.

[White Hat and Cueball walk on, Cueball lifts one hand with the palm up.]

Cueball: I dunno.

Cueball: We've had Photoshop for decades and staged photos for centuries.

Cueball: It hasn't made photos meaningless.

[Zoom in on Cueball, who is turned left towards off-panel White Hat.]

Cueball: The bottleneck for fake stuff isn't technical. The bottleneck is willingness to lie.

Cueball: "People lying" is a very old problem.

Cueball: It's a known exploit.

[Zoom back out on White Hat and Cueball who have stopped. White Hat has a hand on his jaw. Cueball holds his hands out to the sides.]

White Hat: I guess technically we've been able to make ***text*** deepfakes for 5,000 years.

Cueball: Maybe Ea-nasir's copper ingots were actually fine!
