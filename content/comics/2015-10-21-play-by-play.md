  The thrower started hitting the bats too much, so the king of the game told him to leave and brought out another thrower from thrower jail.

[Beret Guy is sitting with headphones with a microphone on, looking out of the frame, hands resting on a table.]

Beret Guy: For those just joining us, hi! We're on part 5 of a hitting game.

[Zoom out with Beret Guy shown from the side sitting at a desk.]

Beret Guy: The next guy has a big bat, so he'll probably hit the ball real far.

Beret Guy: Wait - he missed!

Beret Guy: Oh good, they're letting him try again.

[Zoom in again on Beret Guy still seen from the side.]

Beret Guy: The people sitting on the chair shelves are yelling at this guy but he's ignoring them. Wow.

Beret Guy: Rude.

[Beret Guy looks straight out.]

Beret Guy: This thrower is good! He keeps making people leave by throwing balls at them.

Beret Guy: It's just him, though. None of his teammates are joining in.

[Beret Guy turns his head to the side.]

Beret Guy: *That guy just ran to the second pillow when no one was looking!!*

Beret Guy: Everyone's real mad but I guess they checked the rules and there's nothing that says he can't do that.

Beret Guy: Yikes. Hopefully they can fix that once this game is over.
