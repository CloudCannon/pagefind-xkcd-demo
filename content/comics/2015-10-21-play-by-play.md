  The thrower started hitting the bats too much, so the king of the game told him to leave and brought out another thrower from thrower jail.

Beret Guy: For those just joining us, hi! We're on part 5 of a hitting game.

Beret Guy: The next guy has a big bat, so he'll probably hit the ball real far.   huh?

Wait- he missed! 

-

Oh good, they're letting him try again.

Beret Guy: The people sitting on the chair shelves are yelling at this guy, but he's ignoring them. Wow. 

-

Rude.

Beret Guy: This thrower is good! He keeps making people leave by throwing balls at them. 

-

It's just him though. None of his teammates are joining in.

Beret Guy: That guy just ran to the second pillow when no one was looking! 

-

Everyone's real mad but I guess they checked the rules and there's nothing that says he can't do that.  

-

Yikes. Hopefully they can fix that once this game is over.
