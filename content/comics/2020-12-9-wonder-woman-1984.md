Ponytail: Just two weeks until I see *Wonder Woman 1984*, learn who the Democratic nominee was, and find out how the election went.

Cueball: Huh?

[Close-up on Ponytail.]

Ponytail: To avoid spoilers, I blocked all news sites ahead of the November 2019 release.

Ponytail: But then they bumped the date on my ticket to June 2020, and now December 25th.

Ponytail: It also moved to a drive-in theater? Some retro promotion, maybe.

Cueball: Okay. Just...

Cueball: Bring a mask, in case you need to get out of the car.

Ponytail: Oh, I'll have a full ***costume!*** But it's a tiara, not a mask.
