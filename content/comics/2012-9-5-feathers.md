  Click to see a video of a modern bird using stability flapping during predatory behavior. It all fits! Also, apparently Microraptor had *four* wings? The past keeps getting cooler! (And there's more of it every day!)

[Megan is walking up to Jill with a bow in her hair bun. Jill has a stack of three books in front of her, is reading another book and a fifth book lies behind her on the floor.]

Megan: What are you reading about?

Jill: Dinosaurs!

Megan: Oh, yeah.

[Zoom out of the same scene, with Megan standing and Jill looking up at her.]

Megan: They've gotten all weird since when I was a kid.

Megan: They used to be awesome, but now they all have dorky feathers, right?

Jill: Yup!

[Same scene in a frame-less panel. Jill looks down and below the two characters there is a footnote.]

Jill: This says they now think raptors used their wings for stability, flapping to stay on top of their prey while hanging on with their hooked claws and eating it alive.

[Zoom in on the same scene, the book on the floor is outside the panel. Megan just stands staring at Jill who reads on. Beat panel.]

[Megan is now on the floor next to Jill flipping through the top book she has taken from the pile.]
