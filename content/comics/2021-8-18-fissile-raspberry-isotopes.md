  Grandma's shelf-stable blackberry pie meson recipe was a huge seller until her farm was shut down by a joint FDA/NRC investigation.

[Ponytail and Cueball are standing in a field, looking at rows of crops disappearing in the distance over rolling hills.]

Ponytail: I reckon it'll be a good harvest.

Ponytail: So long as we don't get too many fissile raspberry isotopes.

Cueball: Too many *whats*?

[In a half height panel is shown a picture of a raspberry with an arrow to a situation where it is splitting in to two equal parts. From the split there also comes two small drupelets flying out as shown with arrows. Below these two situations is a smaller sketch of how one of these two drupelets will eventually hit another raspberry, which will send out three drupelets when splitting, two of those hitting other berries, that each send out two drupelets. The lower of these are not depicted hitting any, but the upper split hits two again, which each send out two, in an ongoing chain reaction. The depiction stops there. Above this panel is what Ponytail tells Cueball:]

Ponytail (narrating): If a raspberry breaks in half, it releases fragments which can cause more splits. Within seconds you've lost the whole crop.

[Ponytail and Cueball are standing in an empty panel talking.]

Ponytail: Luckily the berries are bound by fresh raspberry pie mesons.

Cueball: I hope they hold.

Ponytail: It's my grandma's recipe. They'll hold.
