  It's cool how, when there's a number lots of people are curious about, but which isn't easy to measure, some random guess will get cited everywhere and become the universally quoted value. Unrelatedly, did you know there are 850 trillion waves in the ocean?

[Cueball is sitting in an office chair at his desk. He has lifted both arms with palm up towards the screen of his laptop in front of him. Megan stands behind him to the right, looking over his shoulder at the screen.]

Cueball: I hate unsourced statistics.

Cueball: This viral post says hippos kill 2,900 people a year, but this random listicle says 500.

Megan: Makes sense.

Megan: Publishing the real number would be a HIPPO violation.
