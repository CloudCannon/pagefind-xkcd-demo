[It is black, except a few blue and green lights, and red numbers from a clock.]

[The clock shows 4:31]

Lying awake at night I realize how many little lights there are in my room. The alarm clock is the brightest. Can't sleep I'm alone with those glowing red numbers

[The clock now shows 4:32]

Time slows

Does time even exist here?

Thoughts churning in on themselves

[The clock now shows 4:33]

The madness can't be far away

Ah yes

[The clock now shows 13:72]

There it is.
