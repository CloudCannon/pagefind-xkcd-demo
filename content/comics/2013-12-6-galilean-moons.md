Io: Hi!

[Io, which completes a full orbit in each panel, is again near Cueball, as is Europa this time.]

Io: Hi!

Europa: What's your name?

[Io alone again.]

Io: Hi!

[Europa returns to its position near Cueball with Io, and Ganymede joins them.]

[Io alone again.]

Io: Hi!

Callisto: *So annoying*.
