[Close up of Cueball.]

Cueball: Yesssss

Cueball: Inject this directly into my veins

[Beat panel. Ponytail looks down at a clipboard while Cueball is looking at her.]

[Zoom out to reveal that Cueball is standing by a stool, with Ponytail in front of him with a clipboard and syringe and Hairy behind him with a box of bandages and a first-aid kit.]

Ponytail: Ok, but the vaccine is intramuscular...

Hairy: Why do people keep *saying* that?

Cueball: Sorry, sorry.

Cueball: Just excited.
