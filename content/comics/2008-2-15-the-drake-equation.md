The Drake Equation:

N = R\* f<sub>p</sub> n<sub>e</sub> f<sub>l</sub> f<sub>i</sub> f<sub>c</sub> L B<sub>s</sub>

N: Number of communicating civilizations in our galaxy

n<sub>e</sub>: Number of life-supporting planets per solar system

f<sub>i</sub>: Probability that life on a planet becomes intelligent

B<sub>s</sub>: Amount of bullshit you're willing to buy from Frank Drake
