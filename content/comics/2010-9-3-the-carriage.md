  I learned from Achewood that since this poem is in ballad meter, it can be sung to the tune of Gilligan's Island. Since then, try as I might, I haven't ONCE been able to read it normally.

[Death with his scythe is driving a horse-drawn carriage. The text is written in two frames above and below the carriage:]

Because I could not stop for death

He kindly stopped for me

[Hairbun grabs Death by the arm and pulls him off the carriage. There is a circle with the letter Y in the lower left corner. The text above the carriage is in a frame.]

The carriage held but just oursel-

Death: Hey!

Hands holding Death: *Grab*

Circle: Y

[Hairbun takes off in the carriage with the scythe, leaving Death behind on the ground in the dust from the carriage taking off.]

Hairbun: Hyah!

[Hairbun stands with her arms crossed, and Death's scythe next to her. The first text above her is printed as the official logo and the text below is in a type of square brackets.]
