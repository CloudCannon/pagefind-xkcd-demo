[[Man sits on his bed, looking at a girl who is spinning.  It is night.]]

Man on bed: What are you doing? 

Girl: Spinning counterclockwise

Each turn robs the planet of angular momentum

Slowing its spin by the tiniest bit

Lengthening the night, pushing back the dawn

Giving me a little more time here

With you
