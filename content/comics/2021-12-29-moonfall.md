Megan: Are you excited for *Moonfall*?

Megan: Or cringing?

Cueball: Well...

[Closeup on Cueball]

Cueball: I like when stories are grounded in good science because it's exciting to expand our ideas of what's possible.

Cueball: But I also support giving Roland Emmerich as much money as he wants to make cool spaceship noises and smash moons into things.

Megan: Excited to expand our ideas of how much stuff can explode at once.
