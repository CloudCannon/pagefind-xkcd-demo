[A header is above three panels, with each panel containing a title at the top of how funny it would be, a bullet list of five sports, and one or two depictions of Cueball performing sports from that list.]

Header: Olympic Sports ranked by how funny it would be if I, a regular person without athletic training, snuck onto the team to compete:

[The first panel:]

Title:  <u>Not that funny</u>

\*Rowing

\*Fencing

\*Weightlifting

\*Golf

\*Archery

[This panel shows Cueball putting a ball with a golf club and missing the hole from a close distance, and Cueball aiming a bow while three arrows are on the ground at various distances from the target.]

[The second panel:]

Title:  <u>Pretty funny</u>

\*Swimming

\*Long jump

\*Pole vault

\*Diving

\*Hurdles

[This panel shows Cueball running stomach-first into a hurdle, while holding an arm in front of his head. Another hurdle behind him has fallen down.]

Cueball: [Bonk] Ow! [Bonk] Ow!

[The third panel:]

Title:  <u>Incredibly funny</u>

\*Figure skating

\*Horizontal bar

\*Equestrian

\*BMX freestyle

\*Pommel horse

[The first depiction of this panel shows Cueball balancing himself on a pommel horse as if he's riding a real horse, with both of his hands and one leg down and the other leg slightly raised.]

Cueball: Look! Look!

[The second depiction of this panel shows Cueball wearing black helmet and riding a horse, struggling to stay on the running horse with both hands and one leg raised.]

Cueball: AAAAA!
