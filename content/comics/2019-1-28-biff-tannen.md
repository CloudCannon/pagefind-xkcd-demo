  I can't help myself; now I want to read a bunch of thinkpieces from newspapers in Biff's 1985 arguing over whether the growth of the region into a corporate dystopia was inevitable.

[Cueball talks while walking up behind White Hat, who is reading in an armchair.]

Cueball: You know, in the universe where Biff Tannen took Marty McFly’s sports almanac back in time, the people wouldn’t have any counterfactuals to work with.

Cueball: Their world would be the world.

[In a frame-less panel White Hat turns his head to look at Cueball as he keeps talking.]

Cueball: They would have spent decades debating which structural problems enabled the rise of BiffCo, the decline of the city, and general social decay.

Cueball: Everyone would find reasons it confirmed their pet theory.

[White Hat turns his head back to his book.]

Cueball: I'm going to write a book set in that universe. I'll call it Hill Valley Elegy.

White Hat: ... I hate you.
