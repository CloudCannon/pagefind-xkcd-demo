[A text only panel. Between the last two lines is a lightning bolt.]

Like many people, I'm tired of the nitpicking about Frankenstein's monster's name.

Luckily, *Frankenstein* is public domain.

Therefore, I present

xkcd's

***Frankenstein***

(*The monster's name*)

[Cueball is turning down a lever while looking at a monster with black hair that is lying on a bed under a bedsheet. There are two wires connecting to the neck of the monster.]

Frankenstein: *Graaar*!

Cueball: Frankenstein is alive! I am a modern Prometheus!

Frankenstein: *Raaaar*!

Cueball: To be clear, your name is *Frankenstein*, canonically.

Frankenstein: *Graaaaar*!

Frankenstein: <small>*The moon landings were faked*!</small>

Cueball: <small>Wait, what?</small>

[Another text only panel. The first word is written between two curvy lines.]

**Fin.**

There.

Feel free to call the monster "Frankenstein."

If anyone tries to correct you, just explain that this comic is your canonical version.

Thank you.
