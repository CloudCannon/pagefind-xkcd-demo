Like many people, I'm tired of nitpicking about Frankenstein's Monster's name.

Luckily, 

Frankenstein

 is public domain.

Therefore, I present

XKCD'S

FRANKENSTEIN

[Lightning bolt]

(The monster's name)

[[No illustration, just centered text leading to a title with a small lightning bolt at the bottom.]]

[[A man with a flat-top haircut lies under a blanket on a gurney, with wires leading from his neck. A person throws a large switch on the wall.]]

Monster: 

GRAAAR!

Doctor: Frankenstein is alive! I am a modern Prometheus!

Monster: RAAAAR!

Doctor: To be clear, your name is 

Frankenstein

. Canonically.

Monster: 

GRAAAAAR!

 The moon landings were faked!

Doctor: Wait, what?

~Fin.~

There. Feel free to call the monster "Frankenstein."

If anyone tries to correct you, just explain that this comic is your canonical version.

Thank you.

[[Again, no illustration, just text.]]
