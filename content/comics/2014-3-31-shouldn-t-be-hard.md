[Cueball is typing on a laptop.]

Cueball: What I'm trying to do is really simple.

Cueball: It shouldn't be hard.

Offscreen: All computers are just carefully organized sand. ***Everything*** is hard until someone makes it easy.

[Cueball sits back and pauses.]

[Cueball picks up and examines the laptop.]

Cueball: Maybe I should turn this one ***back*** into sand.

Offscreen: I'll find a blowtorch.
