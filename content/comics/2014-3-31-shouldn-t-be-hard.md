[[A person is sitting at a desk, typing on a laptop.]]

Person: What I'm trying to do is really simple. It shouldn't be hard.

[[Someone off-screen speaks.]]

Off-screen: All computers are just carefully organized sand. 

Everything

 is hard until someone makes it easy.

[[The person leans back in their chair.]]

[[The person lifts the laptop off the desk, examining it like a book.]]

Person: Maybe I should turn this one 

back

 into sand.

Off-screen: I'll find a blowtorch.
