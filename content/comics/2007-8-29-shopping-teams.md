Bad: Two non-nerds

First man: Let's get that one.

Second man: okay.

Good: non-nerd + nerd

Woman: Let's get that one.

Man: Wait, I think that one might be a better deal.

Woman: Okay, that one. 

Very Bad: Two Nerds

Man: How about that one?

Second man: i think the other one might be the better deal...

First man: Hmm, I'm not sure...'

Two Hours Later

[[Nerds are sitting in front of laptops with papers strewn about in front of display counter]]

Man: I think our main problem is our unclear definition of value

Woman: That is not your main problem!
