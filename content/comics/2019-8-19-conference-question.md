Beret Guy: I have a question.

Beret Guy: Well, less of a question and more of a comment.

Beret Guy: I guess it's less of a comment and more of an utterance

Beret Guy: Really it's less an utterance, more an air pressure wave.

Beret Guy: It's less an air pressure wave and more a friendly hand wave.

Beret Guy: I guess it's less a friendly wave than it is a friendly bug.

Beret Guy: I found this bug and now we're friends. Do you want to meet it?
