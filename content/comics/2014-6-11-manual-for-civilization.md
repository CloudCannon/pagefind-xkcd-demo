Brian Eno: Hi. I'm music's Brian Eno, co-founder of the Long Now Foundation.

[Panel 2 shows he is standing on a stage.]

Brian Eno: As part of our mission to promote long-term thinking, we've asked experts to help us assemble a collection of books from which civilization can be rebuilt if it ever collapses.

[Panel 3 shows he is holding a manuscript with a long list of book titles.]

Brian Eno: Today we're sharing the results â€” the first ever *Manual for Civilization*.

[Panel 4 shows him reading from the manuscript.]

*Animorphs #2: The Visitor*

Unseen Audience member: ...are they *all* Animorphs Books?

Brian Eno: No! There's also *Megamorphs* and *The Andalite Chronicles*.
