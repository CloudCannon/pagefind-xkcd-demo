[Two Cueball-like guys wearing fencing mask (with gray front over their faces and a strip around their neck) are standing facing each other. The left fencer holds one arm up behind him and the other with the rapier like sword pointing toward the right fencers mask, ready for fencing. The right fencer holds both arms, and thus also the sword, down.]

Left fencer: *En Garde!*

Right fencer: OK.

[In a large frame-less panel where they keep standing in the same position the right fencer talks at length.]

Right fencer: No matter how long we know each other, when you ask "What are you thinking,"

Right fencer: I will always pause before answering.

[Same as the first panel, although the left fencer has lowered the point of his sword so it points straight to the right.]

Left fencer: Maybe a little *less* guarded?

Right fencer: No way. I've been hurt before.
