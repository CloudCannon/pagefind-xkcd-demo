  I love how Google handles dimensional analysis. Stats are ballpark and vary wildly based on time of day and whether your mom is in town.

[A formula is shown with the variables explained above:]

P<sub>d</sub> Regional population density (e.g. 18,600/mi²)

X<sub>f</sub> Average person's frequency of sex (e.g. 80/year)

X<sub>d</sub> Average duration of sex (e.g. 30 minutes)

r=sqrt(2/(π\*P<sub>d</sub>\*X<sub>f</sub>\*X<sub>d</sub>))

On average, someone within distance r of you is having sex.

Cueball: Mmm, That probable couple 150 meters away is so hot. Oh yeah, theoretically work it, baby.

From out of frame: Hey! No statistical voyeurism!
