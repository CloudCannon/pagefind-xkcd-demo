[[Two friends stroll along chatting]]

Hatfriend: Did you watch the super bowl?

Otherfriend: Yes, like a third of the counry.

Otherfriend:A fraction which is INCREASING despite media fragmentation

Hatfriend: Can't we just talk without your weird need to give context for everything?

Otherfriend: Sorry. I'll try.

Hatfriend: Sounds like Peyton Manning's probably going to retire.

Otherfriend: Yes, I.. it..

Hatfriend: C'mon, you can do it!

Otherfriend: He..

Otherfriend: MAMMALS LIKE PEYTON AGE VIA A PROCESS TAHT INVOLVES BOTH THE ACCUMULATION OF DAMAGE AND POORLY-UNDERSTOOD TIMED FACTORS. YET THE CONCEPT OF RETIREMENT ITSELF IS SURPRISINGLY RECENT-

Hatfriend: Okay, good try. Maybe next year.
