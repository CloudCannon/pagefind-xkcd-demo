  Since buns range from crepuscular to nocturnal, it's recommended that you enable the scheduled "Do Not Disturb" mode on your phone to avoid being woken by alerts about Night Buns.

[Beret Guy and Ponytail see a rabbit sitting in the grass; Beret Guy points to the bun.]

Beret Guy: Bun alert!

Ponytail: Oh, yeah! Cute!

Beret Guy: Gotta document this. I'll notify everyone, send out a push alert.

Ponytail: ...to who?

[Zoom in on Beret Guy and Ponytail; Beret Guy taps on his phone.]

Beret Guy: Everyone subscribed to the alert system.

Ponytail: Alert system?

Beret Guy: Yeah! We built it over the last few years. It's pretty small. Still looking for investors.

Ponytail: But...*why* are you alerting people about rabbits?

[Zoom out; Beret Guy puts away his phone, points at the bun.]

Beret Guy: I mean...look at them. They're like loaves of bread that hop.

Ponytail: I see.

Beret Guy: *People need to know.*

[Zoom on Beret Guy in a frameless panel.]

Beret Guy: They need to know:

Beret Guy: ***There are buns.***

[Ponytail walks off, Megan comes running towards Beret Guy with a phone in her hand.]

Ponytail: Okay, uhh, I'm gonna go.

Megan: *I got the alert!* Where's the bun? ***Is it small?***

Beret Guy: *Extremely.*

Megan: Oh my God.
