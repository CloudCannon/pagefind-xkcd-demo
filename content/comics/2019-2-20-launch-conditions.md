  Though I do think the tiny vent on one of the boosters labeled "O-RING" is in poor taste.

[A rocket sits on a launch pad and the tower to the left has retracted its access arms. The engines seem to have just started firing and a small cloud at the bottom is visible.]

[The rocket still sits on the pad but the cloud is growing and extending to both sides on the ground.]

[Ponytail's head, much larger than the rocket, appears above the rocket on the right. The cloud covers the full ground and hides a bigger part of the rocket.]

[Zoom out. Ponytail stands behind a pedestal with a rocket model on top and the cloud is all around the bottom of the rocket and below.]

Off screen: It's still pretty dry in here.

Ponytail: I love the new humidifier, though.
