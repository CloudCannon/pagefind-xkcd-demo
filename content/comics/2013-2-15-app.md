[[A really damn stupid website being viewed in a mobile browser.  A popup covers absolutely everything and makes the entire page unusable.  "Want to visit an incomplete version of our website where you can't zoom? Download our app!". With buttons "OK" and "no, but ask me again every time".  Assholes.]]
