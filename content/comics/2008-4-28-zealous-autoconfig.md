[Cueball is sitting on a chair with his laptop in his lap. The text written on the laptop is shown above him, and there is a zigzag line from the laptop to the bottom of the last sentence.]

Laptop: Starting WiFi autoconfig... searching for WiFi... Found no open networks.

Laptop: Found secure net SSID "Lenhart Family"

[Same setup, but Cueball has changed position. This time there are two zigzag lines between the two sentences from the laptop.]

Laptop: Trying common passwords... Failed. Checking for WEP Vulnerabilities...

Cueball: Um.

Laptop: None found.

[Cueball is still sitting with laptop in his lap, but his hand is on his chin, or perhaps covering his mouth in shock. A phone on table across room starts vibrating. Again, there is only one zigzag line to the bottom sentence from the laptop.]

Laptop: Connecting to Bluetooth phone... Calling local school...

Laptop: Found Lenhart children.

[Zoom back to Cueball, who is furiously typing on his laptop, legs stretched out.]

Laptop: Notifying field agents. Children acquired. Calling Lenhart parents. Negotiating for WiFi password...

Cueball [typing] on laptop: ***Ctrl-C Ctrl-C***
