Spring 2009â€” The new president faces a crisis...

[Cueball is talking to an unseen Mr. President, who is sitting behind a desk.]

Cueball: Mr. President, the bloggers are restless.

Mr. President: What are they a-twitter about now?

Cueball: It's the tubes sir. They're clogged. We put too much stuff on them.

Mr. President: How bad is it?

Cueball: The internet could be inoperative within days.

Cueball: We can't let a crucial resource go unshepherded.

Mr. President: Go on.

Cueball: I recommend you appoint a Secretary of the internet. Someone to impose some orders on this mess.

Mr. President: Ordering bloggers around? Doesn't sound easy.

Cueball: No; it's like herding lolcats.

Mr. President: What?

Cueball: Nothing.

Mr. President: Do you have someone in mind for the post?

Cueball: I know just the guy.

Soon:

Phone: *Ring*
