[[A picture of various apartment buildings]]

Shadowed city slumber silently. A second-story suite.

Come craving courtship, selected serendipitously

Crazed copulations, a salacious storm  of continuous coitus.

Spread, straddled, conquered.  

Countless crashed suitors strewn carelessly.

Centre, silken sheets sensuously caressing soft skin,

Contentedly sleeps your mom.
