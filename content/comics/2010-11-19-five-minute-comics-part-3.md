Because of a family illness, instead of regular comics, this week I'll be sharing some strips that I drew as part of a game I played with friends. Each comic had to be written and drawn in five minutes.

--Randall

;Comic #1

Pearl Harbor. November 7th, 1941.

[There is a beach, with some ships floating in a crescent shaped harbor.]

[The same bay, again.]

[The boats continue to move about the harbor.]

[The boats do their thing. A title explains.]

(We're going to be here a while, since the attack wasn't until December.)

;Comic #2

[Cueball is sitting on a bus, Megan in front of him. Another person is sitting in front of Megan and another person is sitting behind Cueball.]

I know it's natural and all, but I really wish women on the bus wouldn't try to breastfeed me.

Megan: C'mon, have some milk. Right here.

Cueball: I'm *reading*.

;Comic #3

s/I think that/I saw a study once that said that/g

Instant persuasiveness multiplier!

;Comic #4

[A newspaper front page. Billy Joel is between two policemen.]

Times

Billy Joel Arrested for Arson

;Comic #5

[One person has a cord leaving their mouth, the other is holding a handset on the end of it to their ear.]

Handset: Hee hee hee... \*giggle\*

I hear that if you drink coke and eat pop rocks, you vomit up a corded telephone handset on which you hear creepy little girls giggling.

;Comic #6

[Three soldiers are holding a large integral sign, while a fourth points a gun at the Little Rock High School.]

1957: Eisenhower orders the military to integrate Little Rock High School.

;Comic #7

[A smartphone is vibrating across a table, towards a person.]

The smartphones got *too* smart... and developed a taste... for BLOOD!

Fortunately, the only way they could move was by turning on their vibrate while on a sloped table.

;Comic #8

[Cueball is reading to his child.]

Cueball: And the wolf went to see the 38th little pig, who had built his house out of strontium.

Cueball: And the wolf was all, "Ok, what is *with* this shit?"

The 119 Little Pigs

;Comic #9

[Cueball is holding up a gun.]

Cueball: Fastest gun in the west!

[The gun is galloping across the desert.]

*gallop gallop*

[There is a podium, with a gun in each position.]

Winner!

;Comic #10

[A picture of a centrifuge dominates the panel.]

Centrifuges: They're what separate the men from the boys.

;Comic #11

[A computer monitor is plugged in, and cables run into a wardrobe.]

Lucy: Time passes differently in Narnia, so by putting the CPU and storage for my machine there, I was able to run through the Folding@Home and Seti@Home databases in about an hour.

Peter: There are <u>so</u> many problems with that.

;Comic #12

[Someone is talking to Alice.]

Person: One of these days, Alice... Wham, zoom, sploosh, fwoom, splash, gurlle, wheeeee, fwoosh, aren't waterslides fun?!
