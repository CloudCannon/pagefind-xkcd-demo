[Black Hat stands in front of a store counter facing White Hat who stands behind.]

Black Hat: My drone keeps flying into the wrong rooms. Do you have anything to discourage it?

White Hat: Sir, this is a pet store.

Black Hat: Yeah, I was thinking one of those spray bottles for cats.

White Hat: I don't think you can train a drone.

[White Hat hands a spray bottle over the counter.]

Black Hat: Eh, they say that about cats, too. Plus, these days they probably all come with deep learning or whatever. Drones, I mean. Maybe cats too.

White Hat: Fine, here's a bottle.

Black Hat: Do you sell a shock collar that can fit around a Roomba?

White Hat: I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
