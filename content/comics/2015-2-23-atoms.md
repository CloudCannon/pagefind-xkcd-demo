[Megan stands at a table and is preparing a sample for some kind of analysis in a device, when Beret Guy walks in.]

Beret Guy: What're you doing?

Megan: Testing a sample for beryllium.

Beret Guy: That? Yeah, there's a bunch of berylliums.

Megan: How do you know?

[Megan turns to Beret Guy who takes the sample and looks at it.]

Beret Guy: Look at it! See? Tons of oxygens and silicons, a few irons but definitely some berylliums too! Can't you see them?

[They continue to talk.]

Megan: No, I can’t see a list of the atoms in a thing by looking.

Beret Guy: How do you tell what things are?

[Zoom in on Megan.]

Megan: This is ridiculous. Look at me. What do you see?

Beret Guy (off-panel): You have tons of metal in your face. Lots of fillings, I guess?

[Megan stares at Beret Guy who takes a looks at his own arm.]

Megan: What's ***wrong*** with you?

Beret Guy: Too many zincs? I’ve always worried I had too much zinc and everyone thought I was weird.
