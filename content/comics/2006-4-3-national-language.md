This happened to my friend:

[Three men and two women are standing in a row, next to a table on the right.]

Cueball: English should be the national language. These immigrants should have to learn English when they come here.

Megan: Yeah.

Cueball: When you go to live somewhere, you learn the language they speak there.

Cueball: English is the language of the land.

Ponytail: Excuse me, but osio Sarah dawado.

Cueball: What the hell was that?

Ponytail: Cherokee.
