San Francisco, December 9th, 1968:

[A Cueball-like figure talking into a headset. The title of this comic indicates that he is Douglas Engelbart.]

Douglas: ...We generated video signals with a cathode ray tube... We have a pointing device we call a "mouse"... I can "copy" text... ... and we have powerful joint file editing... underneath the file here we can exchange "direct messages"...

[Douglas continues to narrate. Some music is playing.]

Douglas: ...Users can share files... ... files which can encode audio samples, using our "masking codecs"... The file you're hearing now is one of my own compositions...

Music: I heard there was a secret chord

[Douglas continues to narrate.]

Douglas: ...And you can superimpose text on the picture of the cat, like so... This cat is saying "YOLO", which stands for "You Only Live Once"...

Douglas: ...Just a little acronym we thought up...
