[Cueball is sitting in an armchair, playing with an iPad. Megan is looking over his shoulder.]

Cueball: Navigating Google Maps on the iPad is fun. It feels so futuristic.

Cueball: Swoosh! Zoom!

[Close-up on Megan.]

Megan: There are, right now, monkeys controlling robotic arms via neural implants.

Megan: A huge and alien future is barreling toward us. And I can't *wait*.

[Zoom-out on both characters. Cueball is still looking down on his iPad.]

Megan: But no, your iPad is cool, too.

Cueball: Stop spoiling my future with your slightly more distant one.
