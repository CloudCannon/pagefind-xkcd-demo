[[A man is sitting in an armchair, playing with an iPad. A woman is looking over his shoulder.]]

Man: Navigating Google Maps on the iPad is fun. It feels so futuristic.

Man: Swoosh! Zoom!

Woman: There are, right now, monkeys controlling robotic arms via neural implants.

Woman: A huge and alien future is barreling toward us. And I can't WAIT.

Woman: But no, your iPad is cool, too.

Man: Stop spoiling my future with your slightly more distant one.
