[Cueball is looking through a box.]

Cueball: Hey, my old Star Wars books!

[Cueball is holding a pair of books and showing them to Megan.]

Cueball: Man. Timothy Zahn, Michael A. Stackpole, The Corellian Trilogy...

Cueball: This was my <u>world</u>.

Megan: What'd you leave it for? Firefly? BSG?

Cueball: Nah.

Cueball: I guess I've just grown out of the whole obsessive fan mindset.

Megan: Really.

Megan: So how's Ron Paul doing?

Cueball: Ooh! Lemme recheck today's blogs.

[Cueball drops the books and heads off to recheck the blogs.]
