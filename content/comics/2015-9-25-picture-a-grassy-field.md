  Wait, I can fix this. Picture another field. In the middle sits the only creature the first creature is afraid of. Now just-- wait, where did THAT one go?

[[A person monologues to their friend.]]

Picture a grassy field.

In the center sits a small, pale, big-eyed creature with the power to escape from any visualized scene and move freely through the brain that imagined it.

It glances around nervously and--

--whoops, where'd it go?

Sorry about that! Keep an eye out for it in your daydreams.
