  If you're lying in bed tonight and you see yellow eyes glinting in your window, are you being stalked by a puma, a mountain lion, a panther, a catamount, or a cougar? Trick question--in North America, they're all names for the same species, Puma concolor! Isn't learning fun? Anyway, sleep tight!

Parent: Whoa, ever seen Wikipedia's list of people who were attacked and killed by cougars?

Parent: Crazy how many of them were kids who were just playing outside their houses.

Reason #58 I should never have children: My love of learning and sharing knowledge about the world.
