  And even though it all went wrong / I'll stand before the lord of song / with nothing on my tongue but 'I don't understand, I swear I backed up my keyboard config before messing with it'

[Cueball is sitting in an office chair at his desk, typing on his keyboard as shown by small lines over one hand, while looking at the screen of his stationary computer. The screen is on a raised platform on his desk. Lyrical text is written upon each scene, presumably what Cueball is typing.]

I heard there was a secret chord

That David pressed and it typed a word

[A closeup on Cueball in a slim panel. We see him from the waist up, with his hands on the keyboard just beneath the panels frame.]

But you don't use a chorded keyboard, do you

[Same setting as in the first panel, except Cueball's arms have moved and there are movement lines above and below his arms.]

It goes like this, <control> and <shift>

The other hand hits H and <left>

[Slimmer panel but same setting as in the first panel, again the arms have moved a bit, with movement lines above them. The final written word of text is marked as arising directly from the computer.]

And all at once it types out

Computer: Hallelujah
