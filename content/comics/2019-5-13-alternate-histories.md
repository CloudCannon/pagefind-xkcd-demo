[Megan and Cueball are walking together]

Megan: In alternate history stories where the allies lost WWII, sometimes they have their own fiction with the premise "what if the allies had *won*?" which differs from our world since they'd be speculating and wouldn't predict everything.

Cueball: Yeah, I think they do that in *Man in the High Castle*.

[Megan and Cueball continue walking together]

Megan: But within *those* stories, they should have "what if the allies had *lost*?" fiction which is even *more* removed from our world.

Cueball: Uh oh.

Megan: So how deep does it go?

[Cueball and Megan, wearing tall black ball-topped hats and large bracelets and presumably from some alternate history, are walking together. There is a caption in a frame over the top of the panel]

500 levels in:

Megan: In my alternate history, Scotland never develops hovercraft, so Canada's cybernetic horses *defeat* the Belgium-Madagascar-New Jersey alliance.

Cueball: Wow!

[Alternate history Cueball and Megan continue walking together]

Cueball: Then who becomes God-Emperor of Missouri, if not Laura Ingalls Wilder?

Megan: Senator Truman!

Cueball: He survives the accident?!

Megan: Yeah, the pajama craze never catches on, so he's wearing normal clothes when he walks by the printing press...
