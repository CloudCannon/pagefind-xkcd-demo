  I don't know what's worse--the fact that after 15 years of using tar I still can't keep the flags straight, or that after 15 years of technological advancement I'm still mucking with tar flags that were 15 years old when I started.

[Megan and White Hat stand next to a nuclear bomb. The bomb has a hatch open on top, and a small blinking screen. The two people are shouting off-screen.]

Megan: Rob!

Megan: You use Unix!

White Hat: Come quick!

[Megan, White Hat, and Rob look at the screen on the bomb. Rob peers closely. The screen is on the bomb, but is shown at the top of the panel in black with white letters, except "tar" and the last underscore which is in gray and "ten" which is black but written in a white box. The text reads:]

<div style="background-color:black; padding:5px; width:fit-content; margin-left: 2em">

<font color="white">To disarm the bomb,<br>simply enter a valid<br></font><font color="gray">*<tt>tar</tt>*</font> <font color="white">command on your<br>first try. No Googling.<br>You&nbsp;have&nbsp;</font><code><font color="black">ten</font></code>&nbsp;<font color="white">seconds.<br>~# </font> <font color="gray">\_</font>

</div>

[They all stand in the same position, but without the text displayed. Beat panel.]

[Still in the same position but White Hat becomes impatient.]

White Hat: ...Rob?

Rob: I'm so sorry.
