xkcd presents

[In large letters:] <big>**Earth Standard Time**</big>

[In regular text:] (EST)

**A universal calendar for a universal planet**

[In small, grey letters:] <font color="gray">EST is...</font>

<font color="gray"><small>Simple • Clearly defined • Unambiguous</small></font>

<font color="gray"><small>Free of historical baggage • Compatible with old units</small></font>

<font color="gray"><small>Precisely synced with the solar cycle • Free of leap years</small></font>

<font color="gray"><small>Intermittently amenable to date math</small></font>

[Inside the frame a list of the details concerning EST is shown:]

<u>Units</u>

Second: 1 S.I. second

Minute: 60 seconds

Hour: 60 minutes

Day: 1444 minutes <small>(24 hours 4 minutes)</small>

Month: 30 days

Year: 12 months

<u>Rules</u>

For 4 hours after every full moon, run clocks backward.

The non-prime-numbered minutes of the first full non-reversed hour after a solstice or equinox happen twice.

[In two columns the "Epoch" is put into a contrasting juxtaposition to "Time Zones", and the text is smaller:]

Epoch

<small>00:00:00 EST, January 1st, 1970 = 00:00:00 GMT, January 1st, 1970 (Julian Calendar)</small>

Time Zones

<small>The two EST time zones are *EST* and *EST (United Kingdom)*. These are the same except that the UK second is 0.9144 standard seconds.</small>

[The text returns to regular size except when trying to fit text into a space:]

Daylight saving: Countries may enter DST, but no time may pass there.

Narnian Time: Synchronized✔

Year Zero: EST *does* have a year <span style="font-family:consolas">0</span>. (However, there is no 1958.)
