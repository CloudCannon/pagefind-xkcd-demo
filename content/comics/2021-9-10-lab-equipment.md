[Ponytail and Cueball are talking to each other. They are standing between two tables with equipment scattered on them, including lens-stands and eye-protection. Ponytail is pointing away from Cueball towards an unidentified off-panel location.]

Ponytail: The spectrometer is over here, the Nd:YAG lasers are over here,

Every lab in every field has some piece of equipment like this.
