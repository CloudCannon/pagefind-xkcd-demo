([[Hairbun]], [[Danish]] and [[Cueball]] are standing in the background by a coffin. A second Cueball, as the policeman and [[Ponytail]], as the policewoman, are standing in the foreground.)

Ponytail: Good cop. It's a real shameâ€”

Ponytail: He was just one day away from getting put in the locked, heavily guarded room where all cops stay for the last day before they retire.
