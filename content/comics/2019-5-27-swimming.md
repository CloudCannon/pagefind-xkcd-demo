[The single panel comic is around 4 times higher than it is wide (317&times;1284 pixels). A Cueball is watching from the beach while Megan with another character is standing neck deep in water near an extreme drop off (continental shelf?) and another Cueball is swimming further, and there is a fish behind him. This part of the comic is at the very top, and the characters are drawn much smaller than usual.]

Megan: It's OK, I can still touch bottom here.

[As the tall image is scrolled down, there is a school of three fish, a jellyfish, a single deep-water fish, an octopus, a bottom ledge with a toppled beach umbrella on it, and another drop off. The second drop is mostly cut off by the edge of the panel.]

[Caption below the panel:]

I love swimming, but occasionally I realize I don't know how deep the water under me is and it freaks me out.
