[Cueball is holding a plate up in both hand, showing Megan the crepe lying on the plate. His word for crêpe has a different diacritic over the "e" than the normal circumflex (^). Instead it looks more like an open arrow head.]

Cueball: Check out this crêpe I made!

Megan: Weird circumflex, but okay.
