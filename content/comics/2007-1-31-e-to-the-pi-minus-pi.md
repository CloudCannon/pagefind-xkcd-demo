Person: Hey, check it out: e^pi-pi is 19.999099979. That's weird.

Hat Guy: Yeah. That's how I got kicked out of the ACM in college.

Person: . . . what?

Hat Guy: During a competition, I told the programmers on our team that e^pi-pi was a standard test of floating-point handlers--it would come out to 20 unless they had rounding errors.

Person: That's awful.

Hat Guy: Yeah, they dug through half their algorithms looking for the bug before they figured it out.
