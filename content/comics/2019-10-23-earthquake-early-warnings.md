[Megan is looking at her phone while standing next to Cueball]

Megan: Ooh, California has a new earthquake early warning app.

Cueball: Yeah, I'm so mad about it.

[Megan puts her phone down and looks at Cueball who throws his arms up in the air.]

Megan: What, why?

Cueball: It ruins the experience of trying to recognize the p-waves before the obvious main waves hit.

[Megan still looks at Cueball who has taken his arms down.]

Megan: So you're mad about earthquake *spoilers?*

Cueball: I just want to experience the shaking the way the tectonic plate *intended!*
