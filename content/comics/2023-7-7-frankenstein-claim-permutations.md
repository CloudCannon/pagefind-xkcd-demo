|Claim||Notes

|-

|[Open book. Left page says "F", right page shows the monster labeled "?". Arrow pointing to book says "by MS".]<br/><br/>"No, the monster in Mary Shelley's book is unnamed. Frankenstein is the doctor who created him."||This is the normal claim

|-

|[Open book. Left page says "?", right page shows the monster labeled "F". Arrow pointing to book says "by MS".]<br/><br/>"No, the monster in Mary Shelley's novel is named Frankenstein."||Also common, and not worth getting mad about IMO

|-

|[Open book. Left page says "MS", right page shows the monster labeled "?". Arrow pointing to book says "by F".]<br/><br/>"No, Frankenstein is the name of the author. The monster Mary Shelley created is unnamed."||At a glance this could pass for one of the normal claims

|-

|[Open book. Left page says "MS", right page shows the monster labeled "F". Arrow pointing to book says "by ?".]<br/><br/>"No one knows who wrote the novel about Doctor Mary Shelley creating the monster Frankenstein."||I would read this book

|-

|[Open book. Left page says "F", right page shows the monster (with longer hair) labeled "MS". Arrow pointing to book says "by ?".]<br/><br/>"No, Frankenstein is the name of the doctor. The monster he created is Mary Shelley."||rowspan=2|Fully chaotic

|-

|[Open book. Left page says "?", right page shows the monster (with longer hair) labeled "MS". Arrow pointing to book says "by F".]<br/><br/>"No, the doctor who creates Mary Shelley in Frankenstein's novel doesn't have a name."
