[Megan approaches Beret Guy.]

Megan: Any New Year's resolutions?

Beret Guy: Gonna figure out what email is.

Megan: *...Email?*

[Megan points to her phone.]

Beret Guy: People always say they're sending them. They sound really into it, so I always nod, but I have no idea what it is.

Megan: You have an address on your website!

[Megan and Beret Guy walking.]

Beret Guy: Oh, *that's* what that thing is.

Megan: Email is important! You can't just *never* check it. It's not like voicemail.

Beret Guy: Can't they just send messages *normally?*

Megan: How?

Beret Guy: Fax! Or Snapchat.

Megan: ...The naked pic thing?

Beret Guy: Fax machines aren't *just* for faxting!
