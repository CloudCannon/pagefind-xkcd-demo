[Megan is on the phone.]

Megan: Can my boyfriend come along?

[Cueball talks to Megan.]

Cueball: I'm not your boyfriend!

Megan: You totally are.

Cueball: I'm casually dating a number of people.

[Megan points to a chart with gray box plot with a single black dot as an outlier to the far right.]

Megan: But you spend twice as much time with me as with anyone else. I'm a clear outlier.

[Cueball puts his hand on his chin while Megan spreads out her arms.]

Cueball: Your math is irrefutable.

Megan: Face itâ€”I'm your statistically significant other.
