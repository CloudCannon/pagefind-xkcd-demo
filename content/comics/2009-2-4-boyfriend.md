Girl (on the phone): Can my boyfriend come along?

Guy: I'm not your boyfriend!

Girl: You totally are.

Guy: I'm casually dating a number of people.

Girl (pointing to a chart): But you spend twice as much time with me as with anyone else. I'm a clear outlier.

Guy: Your math is irrefutable.

Girl: Face it - I'm your statistically significant other.
