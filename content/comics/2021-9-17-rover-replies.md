[Comments below. Each comment has an icon of a person or other image next to it and an illegible name above the comment.]

[face of Cueball-like character]: These pictures are great!

[curved lines]: I'm so proud of you

[Cueball-like stick figure]: Wow you know a lot about rocks

[Megan]: Go go go go go!

[spiral galaxy-like image]: More propaganda from NASA's 5G vaccine microchip factory

[Ponytail]: Quiet, we're not doing that here

[unidentified stick figure]: Hello from Missouri (Earth)!

[Hairy]: Did you find any skeletons yet

[Blondie]: I hope your helicopter comes back!
