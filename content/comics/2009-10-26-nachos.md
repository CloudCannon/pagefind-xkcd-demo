[Cueball is on the phone with Ponytail, who's on her computer in the other half of a split panel.]

Cueball: Hello? ... Oh, hey. Looking for Megan? She's gaming.

Ponytail: I know. You know what's delicious? Nachos.

[Ponytail clicks on her computer while talking.]

Ponytail: When you layer the cheese so it gets on every chip... then smother them in sour cream and salsa...

Cueball: Mm, that IS delicious. And I've got the ingredients, too!

Ponytail, on phone: You should make some!

Cueball: I will!

Ponytail, on phone: Hurry.

[Cueball is making nachos in the microwave.]

Microwave: *beep beep whirrrr*

Megan, at her computer: My wifi signal!

[Ponytail who called is at her computer.]

Computer: Boom! Headshot.
