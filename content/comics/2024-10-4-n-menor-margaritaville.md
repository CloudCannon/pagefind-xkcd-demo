  I see white shores, and beyond it, a far green country under a tequila sunrise.

[An Elf woman with a decorated headband around her long blonde hair and wearing a long dress is walking and talking with Cueball who walks ahead of her looking back at her over his shoulder.]

Elf: Aragorn was king of Gondor, but we Elves remember when his line ruled Númenor.

Cueball: Oh, the place from the Jimmy Buffett songs?

[Closeup on Cueball who has stopped and turned towards the now off-panel Elf. The Elf's reaction is coming from a star burst in the top left corner of the panel.]

Elf [off-panel]: What.

Cueball: The semi-mythical seafaring Atlantic paradise? He sang about it. With the fancy cocktails?

[Zoom back out showing that the Elf and Cueball are now standing facing each other.]

Elf: ...You mean Margaritaville?

Cueball: Yeah, that must be the modern name.

[Another closeup on Cueball with the Elf speaking off-panel as before.]

Elf [off-panel]: Númenor is not Margaritaville.

Cueball: "I'd rather die while I'm living than live while I'm dead," sang Ar-Pharazôn, king of island life.

[Zoom back out to see the Elf is now facepalming while Cueball continues.]

Elf: Please stop.

Cueball: "If there's a heaven for me, I'm sure it has a beach attached" is about the shores of Tol Eressëa.

[The Elf is walking away from Cueball who raises his finger in the air.]

Elf: See, this is why I'm leaving the world of Men.

Cueball: You shall diminish, and go into Key West.
