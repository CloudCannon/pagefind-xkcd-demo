[A Cueball-like guy standing behind a desk looking at a computer screen services Megan and Cueball on the other side of the desk.]

Guy: We have two rental cars left.

Guy: One is the murder car. But don't let the name scare you!

Guy: It's definitely haunted. But most drivers don't get murdered.

Guy: Maybe one in six.

[The guy lifts his hand and looks at Megan and Cueball.]

Guy: The other is a regular sedan.

Guy: But it has a GPS that's stuck trying to navigate to Seattle, and you canâ€™t turn it off.

Megan: ...I can ignore it, right? That's fine.

[In a frame-less panel Megan and Cueball drive in the sedan.]

GPS: Turn left

GPS: Recalculating

GPS: Make a U-turn

GPS: Recalculating

GPS: Turn right

GPS: Make a U-turn

GPS: Recalculating

[Megan and Cueball walk back into the agency with the guy behind his desk. Megan holds out the car keys in one hand.]

Guy: Back already?

Megan: We'll take the murder car.

Guy: Popular choice.
