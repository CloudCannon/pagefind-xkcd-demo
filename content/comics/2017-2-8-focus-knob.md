  Maybe if I spin it back and forth really fast I can do some kind of pulse-width modulation.

Personal Focus

[A gray rotary control knob with the range of options divided by small ticks on a black arc. The knob has a black line that indicates that the knob's setting. At the bottom left and right where the semi circle begins and ends there are two labels in normal black text:]

Left: Detail-Oriented

Right: Big Picture

[Above and all along the black semi circle with the range, another semi circle is drawn in light gray. This has been divided into three sections, with two large sections left and right forming the actual semi circle with double arrow lines. There is a short section with no tick inside it between the two other sections. There are three labels for each of these section, with a line from the label down to the small section. All described here are drawn light gray color.]

Left section: <span style="color: gray;">Fiddling with email settings</span>

Right section: <span style="color: gray;">Panic and existential paralysis</span>

Small section: <span style="color: gray;">Healthy balance</span>

[A gray rotary control knob with the range of options divided by 37 small ticks on a black arc that extends over 270 degrees from 45 degrees past "6 o'clock" and around to 45 degrees before that "time" on the other side. The first and last tick are a bit larger than the other 35. The knob has a black line that indicates that the knob's setting is on the 13th line from left. This also seem to indicate that the knob can only point to the ticks and not in between them. At the bottom left and right where the arc begins and ends there are two labels in normal black text.]

[Above and all along the black semi circle with the range, another set of arcs are drawn in light gray. These has been divided into three sections, with two large sections left and right forming most of the major arc, which here consist of two double ended arrows pointing to four stopping lines orthogonal to the gray arrows pointing at them. The left and right stopping lines are above the larger left and right end ticks below. The other two stops are very near each other, the left just slightly past the 24th tick (from left) and the next is just short of the next 25th tick (but not as near as the other line was to the 24th tick). There is no line or arrow between these two very close stopping lines. There are three labels. The labels for the first section (spanning slightly more than 24 ticks) and the second section (spanning a bit more 13 ticks) have their labels written next to the arrows, which has been broken in order to have the text written next to the black arc. The remaining small space lies between the 24th and 25th tick, and it thus have no possible settings within it - i.e. no tick is inside this section, and it is the only part not encompassed by the two double arrows. It is labeled to the right of it, and a line goes from the label down to indicate this small section. All the above including the text is drawn in the same light gray color.]
