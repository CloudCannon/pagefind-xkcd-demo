[Cueball and Megan standing together looking to the right.]

Cueball: I heard that during an eclipse the birds all freak out.

Megan: I guess we'll see!

[Beat panel, the white background sky turns at the top slightly darker.]

[As the sky turns to dusk sounds can be heard. It's written above Cueball and Megan inside squiggly bubbles.]

Chirp Chirp!

Chirp!

Peep peep peep!

Squawk!

[The sky is now nearly dark, more at the top of the panel. The sounds continue, written in similar bubbles.]

Chirp!

Clank clank clank

The time is upon us!

Peep!

Kachunk

Prepare the blood cauldron!

Cueball: Wow.

Megan: Isn't nature amazing?
