[A restaurant. Blondie is with two small Cueballs at a table; Bill Nye with black hair in a white lab coat sits at the next table with his back turned towards them. Two other tables can be seen at the edge of the panel at either side. A caption is written above them:]

The tribulations of Bill Nye:

Blondie: Hey, kids, see how the ice cracks and pops in your water? I wonder what causes that...

Blondie: \*Ahem\* I said, I wonder whatâ€”

Bill Nye: Know what? Maybe I just wanna enjoy my goddamn meal.
