[Caption at the top of this chart:]

<big>**Earth's <big><big>Land Mammals</big></big> by Weight**</big>

[Below the caption is a light gray block with a label (in light gray as well) to indicating the value of each block:]

<font color="gray">= 1,000,000 tons</font>

[Below this there is a row with three blocks each in a different color, dark and light gray and green, each block is labeled to the right:]

**Humans**

**Our pets and livestock**

**Wild animals**

[The rest of the comic consist of a chart with different groups made up of these individually and differently colored blocks, each grouping representing the weight of a different mammals, except the center part, the only one with dark gray block, which represent humans. The largest group to the left is the only one larger than the humans group in the center. There are 22 groups in total, 1 human group with 358 dark gray block, 13 groups of light gray with a total of 864 blocks and 8 green groups with a total of 34 blocks for a total of 256 blocks. Both the light gray and the green groups are spread out on all sides of the human center group. Only difference is that all the green are on the very outside, whereas some of the smaller light gray groups are close to the core, far from the outside. The five largest groups of light gray blocks are labeled, as well as the smallest group consisting only of a single green block. All the labels has a line pointing to the relevant group and all of them are on the outside of the entire block. Going clockwise from the top left the labels are:]

<big><font color="gray">Cattle</font></big>

<big><font color="gray">Pigs</font></big>

<big><font color="gray">Goats</font></big>

<big><font color="gray">Sheep</font></big>

<big><font color="gray">Horses</font></big>

<big><font color="gray">Elephants</font></big>

[At the bottom right of the comic is the following gray text with a reference:]
