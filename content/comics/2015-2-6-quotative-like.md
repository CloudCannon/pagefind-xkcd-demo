[[Two stick figures are walking, one is holding an article]]

Figure A: I found this article on the linguistics of the "Quotative Like".

Figure B: Like when you're like, "She was like"?

Figure A: Yeah.

Figure A: It features a quote from a linguist, Patricia Cukor-Avila: "Eventually all the people who hate this kind of thing are going to be dead, and the ones who use it are going to be in control."

Figure B: Wow. Turns out linguists are pretty hardcore.

Figure A: I think she means dead from old age.

Figure B: I'm gonna start using "Like" more, just in case.
