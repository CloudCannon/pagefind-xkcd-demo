[Megan referring to a published article she is holding.]

Megan: I found this article on the linguistics of the "Quotative Like".

Cueball: Like, when you're like, "She was like"?

Megan: Yeah.

Megan: It features a quote from a linguist, Patricia Cukor-Avila: "Eventually all the people who hate this kind of thing are going to be dead, and the ones who use it are going to be in control."

Cueball: Wow. Turns out linguists are pretty hardcore.

Megan: I *think* she means dead from old age.

Cueball: I'm gonna start using "like" more, just in case.
