  I wrote 20 short programs in Python yesterday. It was wonderful. Perl, I'm leaving you.

[A Cueball-like friend is talking to Cueball, who is floating in the sky.]

Friend: You're flying! How?

Cueball: Python!

Cueball: I learned it last night! Everything is so simple!

Cueball: Hello world is just print "Hello, World!"

Friend: I dunno... Dynamic typing? *Whitespace?*

Cueball: Come join us! Programming is fun again! It's a whole new world up here!

Friend: But how are you flying?

Cueball: I just typed 'import antigravity'

Friend: That's it?

Cueball: ...I also sampled everything in the medicine cabinet for comparison.

Cueball: But I think this is the python.
