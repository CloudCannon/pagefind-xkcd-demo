The layers of the Earth

[Cutaway diagram of the Earth, a sphere with abstract sea/land/elevation surface, except for a slice removed (quarter-arc in three axes) to make visible a number of roughly equally-sized 'strata'/shells, all the way down to the intact smallest sphere. From surface downwards, these are:]

Lithosphere/crust (50/50 blend)

Upper mantle

Deep mantle

Filler

Vitreous humor

Mechanical/HVAC layer

Guacamole

Cytoplasm

Cork

Insulation

Seeds

Pith

Nougat

Outer core

Inner core

Secret core
