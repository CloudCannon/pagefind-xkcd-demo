[Cueball is pulling a crossbow out of a desk.]

Cueball: Why do you have a crossbow in your desk?

Megan (off-screen): You *don't*?

[Pan to Megan who looks towards Cueball who is off-screen to the left.]

Cueball (off-screen): No—why would—

Megan: You *are* studying the consequences of Higgs excitation, aren't you?

Megan: Like the rest of the lab?

[Cueball, now carying Megan's crossbow joins her as the panel extends to include another Cueball-like guy to her right, he also carries a crossbow.]

Cueball: Yes, but why—

Guy: Maybe he's slow with the math.

Megan: Well, he has until Tuesday.

Guy: Poor guy.
