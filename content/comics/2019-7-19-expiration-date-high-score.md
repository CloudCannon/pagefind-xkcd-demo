[Title up in the panel:]

What's the most expired item you've found in your house?

Calculate your

Expiration Date High Score

(must be something *you* purchased)

[Equation in a circle:]

Score = (year you found item) minus (year item expired) divided by (your age when you found it), multiplied by 100

[Megan and Cueball talking in a kitchen, with Megan holding a can.]

Megan: These beans expired in 2010! That's... let's see... 24.3! New personal best!

Cueball: You're never going to beat your mom's jar of pickles from 1978.

Megan: Maybe there are more cans in there. Remind me not to look until 2030.

Cueball: This is the worst competition.
