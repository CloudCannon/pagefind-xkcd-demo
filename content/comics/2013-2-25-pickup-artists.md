[[Beret guy and another man stand talking to each other.]]

Beret guy: What've you been up to lately? 

Man: I've been hanging out with some pickup artists. I'm learning a *lot!*

Beret guy: Oh, that sounds like fun! 

The world seems like a happier place if you think "Pickup artist" is like "Pickup basketball player."
