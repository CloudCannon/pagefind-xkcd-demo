[A graph with the x-axis labeled, and the scale indicated from left to right:]

Far

Human proximity to cat

Near

[Two curves are  drawn and labeled, first the one starting on top, which then veers downwards and crosses the other as that curve veers upwards.]

Intelligence

Inanity of statements

[Below the graph, Cueball is seen standing at three distances from a cat that is drawn to the far right. The two first Cueballs are just standing, one below far, the other in the middle, and the last is standing close to the cat (below near) with his hands up, and he is speaking.]

Cueball: You're a kitty!
