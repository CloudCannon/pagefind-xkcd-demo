[Upon a background of astrological imagery merged in accord, basic point-and-line astronomical/astrological representations of Scorpio, Libra, Virgo and Leo are illustrated.]

[(Scorpio may be slightly rotated/translated for aesthetic reasons.)]

[Red lines have been added to link stars in adjacent constellations.]

[ Beta Scorpii [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_Scorpii] may be connected to Sigma Librae [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigma_Librae] (once known as Gamma Scorpii)]

[ ...also Pi Scorpii [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi_Scorpii] may be connected to Tau Librae [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau_Librae]]

[ Beta Librae [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_Librae] may be connected to Mu Virginis [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu_Virginis]]

[ Nu Virginis [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nu_Virginis] may be connected to Beta Leonis (better known as Denebola [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denebola])]
