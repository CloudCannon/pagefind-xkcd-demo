[White Hat is spreading his arms and facing Cueball.]

White Hat: We wouldn't have all these problems if people just learned to be more *logical* and *science-driven* instead of relying on *feelings*.

Cueball: Oh? What study are you basing that on?

White Hat: It just seems obvious!

White Hat: I mean, look at the crap these idiots believe!
