[Cueball is pointing a stick at a poster hanging behind him while addressing an unseen audience. There are two graphs on the poster with data points and fitting curves.]

Cueball: We realized all our data is flawed.

[The three next panels all have a label in a frame going over the top of each panels frame. The poster can no longer be seen in the rest of the panels.]

Label: Good

[Cueball has taken the stick down.]

Cueball: ...So we're not sure about our conclusions.

Label: Bad

[Cueball holds the pointer almost as in the first panel.]

Cueball: ...So we did lots of math and then decided our data is actually fine.

Label: Very bad

[Cueball holds the pointer so it point upwards. Also he lifts his other hand a bit up.]

Cueball: ...So we trained an AI to generate better data.
