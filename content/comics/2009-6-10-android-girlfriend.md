[Cueball, holding his hand on Megan's shoulder, talks to his Cueball-like friend, who is holding a drink glass with a cherry.]

Cueball: Check out my new android girlfriend.

Friend: Is she a sex bot?

[The android grabs the cherry out of the friend's drink glass.]

Grab

[Zoom in on the cherry as the stem is ripped off.]

Plink

[Zoom to the android, who puts the stem into its mouth.]

Nom

[The panel is dark gray, except around the android's mouth, where there is a bright flash and then a brighter cross going out from there. Both Cueball and his friend hold up their hands to protect their eyes.]

Kzzzzt

[The android takes a step away from Cueball and reaches toward the friend's crotch. The friend holds up his hand protectively in front of him.]

Friend: I don't think arc-welding a cherry stem counts as sexy.

Android: Remove your pants.

Friend: No.
