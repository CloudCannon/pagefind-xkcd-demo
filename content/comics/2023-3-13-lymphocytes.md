[Title] Lymphocytes

[Subtitle] And their functions

[A 4 by 3 grid of frames, each containing the name of the lymphocyte, a visual depiction of the cell and a description]

[Row 1, Column 1]

Plasma B cells

[Egg-like shaped cell with the nucleus right from the middle]

Churn out antibodies

[Row 1, Column 2]

Naïve B cells

[Almost circular cell with the nucleus in the middle]

Try to stop pathogens by asking nicely

[Row 1, Column 3]

Memory B cells

[Like panel 2, but with some music notes next to it, as if it produces sound]

Very quietly sing "memory" from Cats at all times

[Row 1, Column 4]

Regulatory B cells

[Like panel 2]

Required by local ordinance

[Row 2, Column 1]

CD8+ T cells

[Also oblong, but with the nucleus left from the middle]

Melee combat

[Row 2, Column 2]

CD4+ T cells

[Circular, with a large nucleus, saying ‘AAAAAAAAA!’]

Scream at other cells

[Row 2, Column 3]

Gamma-Delta T cells

[Dashed circle with a question mark in the middle]

Unknown / classified

[Row 2, Column 4]

CDRW+ T cells

[Shaped like a CD, with a large hole in the middle]

Rewritable, 700MB

[Row 3, Column 1]

DVD+R T cells

[Shaped like a DVD, with a bit smaller hole in the middle]

Different from DVD-R, though no one is sure how

[Row 3, Column 2]

Natural killer cells

[Irregularly shaped oblong cell with nucleus in the middle]

Named by the world's coolest immunologist

[Row 3, Column 3]

ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3 cells

[Three cells]

Named by a significantly less cool immunologist

[Row 3, Column 4]

D cells

[Cylindrical shaped ‘cell’, with a smaller cylindrical ‘nucleus’ inside it at the right, roughly shaped like a D battery]

Larger than C and AA cells, used in old flashlights
