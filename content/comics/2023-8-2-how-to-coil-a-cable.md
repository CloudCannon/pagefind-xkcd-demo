How to Coil a Cable Properly

[A drawing of a tangled cable appears below the title.]

Step 1

[Cueball is standing holding a tangled mess of cable in both hands. Each end of the cable is dragging on the ground.]

Cueball: I need to buy a different brand of cable! This one always twists into spirals and gets tangled.

Step 2

[Ponytail enters the panel from the left, and White Hat enters from the right, to come to Cueballâ€™s rescue.]

White Hat: No! That's because of how you're coiling it!

Step 3

[White Hat holds and coils the cable while he, Hairy, and Ponytail attempt to explain the method behind the cable coiling. Ponytail, White Hat, and Hairy all have the same speech balloon, with many of the words replaced by scribbles to indicate that they are talking over each other and/or that Cueball can only make out a few phrases. Only the following dialogue in the word balloon is legible.]

Ponytail / White Hat / Hairy: ...over-under method... ...figure-8... ...quarter-turn... ...flaking...

Step 4

[White Hat presents the well-coiled cable. A caption with an arrow points to the cable:]

Neatly coiled!
