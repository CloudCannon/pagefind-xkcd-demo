Salesman: Interested in updating your antivirus software?

Cueball: Oh, I wouldn't need any of that.

[In a spiky speech bubble.]

Cueball: I run Linux.

[Cueball does a backflip onto a motorcycle.]

*Flip*

[Cueball performs a wheelie on the motorcycle.]

[Cueball does a hard, donut turn on the motorcycle, kicking up dirt into the salesman's face.]

[Cueball speeds off on the motorcycle, leaving the salesman in a cloud of black exhaust.]
