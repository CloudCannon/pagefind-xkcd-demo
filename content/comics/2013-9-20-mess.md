[Cueball and his Cueball-like friend walk into the friend's bedroom. The friend walks ahead while Cueball stand behind at the door. There's a made bed, a picture on the wall with a river and a sun at the horizon, some curtains around the window, a rug, and one unidentifiable item lying on the floor.]

Friend: Sorry it's such a disaster in here.

Cueball thinking: Whoaâ€” what's *wrong* with me?
