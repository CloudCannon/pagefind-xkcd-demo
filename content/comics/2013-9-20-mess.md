[[Two figures walk into a bedroom. There's a bed, a picture on the wall, some curtains, a rug, and one item on the floor. On the whole, the room is immaculate.]]

Figure 1: Sorry it's such a disaster in here.

Figure 2: {{inside a thought bubble}} whoa- what's wrong with me?

My room never looks as nice as the rooms other people apologize for.
