[Megan is standing facing right, talking to Cueball who is sitting at a computer desk and also facing right, looking at a computer screen.]

Cueball: Oh cool, they just found a dinosaur that was buried by a volcanic eruption 125 million years ago.

Megan: Wow.

[Pause. Megan is still facing right. Panel closes in on Megan and Cueball is not shown. This panel has no dialogue.]

[Megan has stepped closer to Cueball, who leans in and is still looking at the screen.]

Megan: Was it okay?

Cueball: Hmm, it doesn't say.
