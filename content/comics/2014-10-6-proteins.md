[Cueball is talking with Megan.]

Cueball: What do you do?

Megan: I make software that predicts how proteins will fold.

Cueball: Is that a hard problem?

Megan: Someone may someday find a harder one.

Cueball: Why is it so hard?

Megan: Have you ever made a folded paper crane?

Cueball: Yeah.

Megan: Imagine figuring out the folds to make an actual *living* crane.

Cueball: ...*just* folds? Can I make cuts?

Megan: If you can fold a protease enzyme.
