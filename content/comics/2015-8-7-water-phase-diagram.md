[A phase diagram is shown with eight labeled regions.]

[The horizontal axis, increasing in value to the right is labeled:]

Temperature

[The vertical axis, increasing in value downwards is labeled:]

Pressure

[Region alongside the "Pressure" axis covering about half of its length is labeled:]

Ice

[Region spanning top-right corner of graph, i.e. higher temperatures and lower pressures. The region is labeled:]

Water vapor

[Region below "Water vapor" and to the right of "Ice" is labeled:]

Liquid water

[Three small regions below "Ice" are going from left to right on the same pressure region, the last ending just under "Liquid water". They are each labeled:]

Ice II

Ice III

Ice V

[Region below "Ice II", "Ice III", "Ice V" and "Liquid water" is labeled:]

Vanilla Ice

(Ice VI)

[Below "Vanilla Ice" there is a dashed line with two arrows pointing downwards. The region below the dashed line is labeled:]
