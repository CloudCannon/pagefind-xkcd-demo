  You can pour a drink into it while hosting a party, although it's a real pain to fit in the dishwasher afterward.

[The comic shows a square table with a glass surface. The glass surface is not clear enough to see through and may be located on top of an opaque surface. A drinking glass stands nearly half-way over the right edge of the table, so it looks like it is in 'danger' of falling. Apparently, however, it seems that this glass is merged with the glass surface of table, thus it cannot fall off or be removed. There is a caption below the panel:]

The least popular item at my furniture store is probably the table with a decorative drinking glass built into the edge of the glass top.
