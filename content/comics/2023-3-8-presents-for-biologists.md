  A lot of these are actually non-venomous, but I can see which species you mistook them for. If you pause the crane for a sec I can give you some ID pointers for next time!

[James Bond, drawn as Hairy, and Hairbun are hanging upside down from ropes attached to one of their ankles. Underneath them is a pit with many snakes. Hairbun is pointing down, while Black Hat to the left is operating a lever. Bond is yelling at Black Hat, indicated by lines emanating from his head. Hairbun is also yelling, but that is in the direction of the snakes beneath them. There seems to be many snakes in the pit, at least eight heads can be seen, and there are also snakes whose heads are not visible. At least six snakes are partly outside the pit. They have different patterns of spots, shades, and stripes.]

Bond: You won't get away with this!

Hairbun: Ooh! Ooh! That one is a new species for me!

Hairbun: Hey, can you lower me faster? It's getting away!

There's a surprising amount of overlap between "Good presents for biologists" and "Things villains want to do to James Bond."
