[[A man sits at a computer, hand over the keyboard]]

Computer: Okay, human.

Man: Huh?

Computer: Before you hit 'compile,' listen up.

Computer: You know when you're falling asleep, and you imagine yourself walking or something, and suddenly you misstep, stumble, and jolt awake?

Man: Yeah!

Computer: Well, that's what a segfault feels like. <<Pause>> Double-check your damn pointers, okay?
