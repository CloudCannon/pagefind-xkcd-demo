((Four figures hold forth with expository monologue.))

Figure holding a camera: I'm doing an art project where I take a picture of myself every hundred years.

Figure holding a phone: I'm doing an art project where I take a picture of myself every one twenty-fourth of a second.

Figure pointing to their face: I'm doing an art project where you can come to my house and watch my actual face age in real time.

Figure holding a burrito to their face: I'm doing an art project where you all do those things while I eat a burrito.
