[Black Hat is holding a genie lamp in his hands. A genie has appeared from the end of the lamp. The genie is depicted as a turbanless Cueball-like figure floating without a lower body, having a puff of smoke in place of his legs.]

Genie: I will grant you one wish.

Genie: But beware, for I will twist the meaning of your words to teach you a lesson!

[Black Hat holds the lamp to his side. The genie has his arms crossed.]

Black Hat: Gotcha! Hmm.

Black Hat: I'm tired of carrying an umbrella. I wish it never rained again.

[Close-up on the genie.]

Genie: ...Okay.

Genie: I'm supposed to twist your words to teach you a lesson, but that actually sounds very straightforwardly bad.

Genie: Can you maybe try again?

[Zoom back to Black Hat and the genie.]

Black Hat: Fine. Just give me what I deserve.

Genie: Oh my god. Have you read ***any*** stories about wishes?

Black Hat: Come on! I want to get what's coming to me.

Genie: Listen, I'm just gonna give you $20 and call this even.
