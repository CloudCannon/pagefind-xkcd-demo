[First panel, Megan and Cueball talking]

Cueball: You know,

Cueball: I remember the first thing anybody ever said to me on the internet.

Megan: Yeah?

[Second panel, part-height to accomodate Cueball's narration above and the memory of a scene below that features 'Young Cueball', with a mop-head of hair, knelt atop a chair to use a computer with CRT and keyboard on the desk, cabled down into a floor-standing minitower case below]

Cueball (narrative): I was in an AOL Kids chat room in 1993.

Cueball (narrative): People there kept using a name I didn't recognise.

Cueball (narrative): After a while I asked what it was.

Young Cueball (via the use of the keyboard): W...H...O... &nbsp;I...S... &nbsp;G...R...

[Third panel, close-up of Cueball's adult head, continuing the framing conversation]

Cueball: Someone replied.

Cueball: "If you don't know who Green Day is, you have a serious problem."

Cueball: And that was it. My first virtual interaction.

[Fourth panel, continuing the conversation, Megan and Cueball now seen walking rightwards as they speak]

Megan: In some ways, the Internet has changed surprisingly little in the last 30 years.

Cueball: Every time I reply to someone, I think

Cueball: What if this is their Green Day moment?
