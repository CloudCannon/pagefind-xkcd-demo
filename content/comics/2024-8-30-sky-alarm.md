[A rectangular device with a light on top and a label on its side, is seen resting on a stool to the left. It is activated and the light on top of it is glowing and a voice is emanating from it, maybe even speaking the siren part of the sound that comes between sentences. Cueball, sitting on an office chair at his desk, looks away from his laptop so he is now facing the device while Megan is on the other side of the desk running away from it towards the right edge of the panel.]

Label: Sky Alarm

Sky alarm: *Weeee Ooooo Weeee Ooooo*

Sky alarm: *There's a cool space thing happening!*

Sky alarm: *Weeee Ooooo Weeee Ooooo*

Sky alarm: *Go outside and look up!*

[Caption below the panel:]

I want this device.
