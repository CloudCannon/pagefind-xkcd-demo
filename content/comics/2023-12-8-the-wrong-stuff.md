[A ghost is approaching Cueball in a workshop. They are surrounded by shop equipment, such as a table with a press on it, and a small pile of what appears to be lumber. Cueball is backing away from the ghost, holding his hands up defensively.]

Ghost: oooOOOOOOoooo

[The "ooooo"s of the ghost are written in wavy letters of varying sizes]

Ghost: *Build a spaceship out of bricks!*

Ghost: oooooOOOOOOOOoo

Cueball: No! Go away!
