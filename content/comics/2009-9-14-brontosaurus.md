[Cueball and Megan are sitting at a bench. Megan is holding a turtle.]

Megan: Our love is like a turtle.

[Megan sets down the turtle and turns to Cueball. They hold hands.]

Megan: Humble and simple, enduring by virtue of perfect design.

Cueball: Our love is like a brontosaurus.

Cueball: Recognized as a mistaken combination long ago, lingering only out of misplaced affection for an imagined past.
