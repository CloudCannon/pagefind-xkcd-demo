[A page from a very long thread on "*FREE* Energy ~Forum~."]

**Thread:** You're all crackpots who don't understand thermodynamics.

[A bar above the comments:] Page 547 of 547 <<First <Prev <u>1</u> <u>2</u> <u>3</u>... <u>545</u> <u>546</u> **547**

Poster 1 [Default face icon]: No, idiot, only the *north* end of a magnet increases entropy. The south end decreases it.

Poster 2 [Power strip plugged into itself icon]: I wiki'd this "First Law" and I don't see the issue. My device isn't a robot and doesn't harm humans.

Poster 3 [Person with a large structure behind them icon]: What if we trick the government into only suppressing the *left* side of the flywheel?

Ironically, the argument I started on a perpetual motion forum in 2004 shows no signs of slowing down.
