[Megan is sitting on a couch with Cueball lying in her lap, his feet going out over the armrest.]

Cueball: There's nowhere I'd rather be than with you here right now.

[Zoom in on Megan, still showing Cueball's head in her lap.]

[Further zoom in on Megan, so only most of Cueball's head can be seen. The couch is only partly sketched, and behind her three thought bubbles lead to a day dream she is having, where we see she is imagining herself riding an apatosaurus, holding the reins going into the dinosaurs mouth.]
