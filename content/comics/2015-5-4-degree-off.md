  I'M SORRY, FROM YOUR YEARS OF CONDESCENDING TOWARD THE 'SQUISHY SCIENCES', I ASSUMED YOU'D BE A LITTLE HARDER.

[Hairy is acting as the host of a TV talk show, *Degree-Off* holding a microphone up. Cueball, Hairbun, and Megan are acting as representatives of physics, biology, and chemistry, respectively. They each stand behind their own lectern with the respective subject label.]

Hairy: Welcome to the ***Degree-Off***, where we determine which field is the best! Physics, wanna go first?

Cueball (Phys): Sure! I'd like to tell the story of Richard Feynman's Manhattan project lockpicking pranks...

Labels: Phys Bio Chem

[Zoom in so Megan is no longer visible. Cueball lifts his hand]

Cueball (Phys): ...and as he said, "all science is either physics or stamp collecting."

Cueball (Phys): <small>Thank you.</small>

Hairy: *Great!* Bio, you wanna go next?

Hairbun: Okay.

Labels: Phys Bio

[Zoom in on Hairbun so only she and her lectern are shown. A graph is shown above her. There is a label for the y-axis to the left of the axis which has four ticks with numbers. The x-axis is a timeline without ticks but three years indicating the start center and end of the axis. The graph shows a curve falling off, with one great spike up around 1920.]

Y-axis label: Per 100,000

Y-axis:

800

600

400

200

X-axis: 1900 1950 2000

Hairbun (Bio): This is a graph of the death rate from infectious disease in this country.

Labels: Bio

[Zoom back to original scene with Hairy holding the microphone down and Hairbun raising her left hand, while Cueball looks at her.]

Hairbun (Bio): The heroes of my field have ***slain*** one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse.

Labels: Phys Bio Chem

[Zoom in on only Cueball and Hairbun who is pointing aggressively at Cueball who leans away from her one hand on his lectern for support.]

Hairbun (Bio): While the heroes of ***your*** field gathered in the desert to create a new one.

Labels: Phys Bio

[Zoom back to previous scene all are holding their hands down.]

Cueball (Phys): ...Jeez, what the hell? I thought this was supposed to be fun and lighthearted!

Hairbun (Bio): ***You must have been thinking of stamp collecting.***
