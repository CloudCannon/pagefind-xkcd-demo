  This was an actual mock conversation between me and a friend at TGiF.  The waitress walked up around panel 5 and was somewhat put off.

[[Two guys stand together]]

First Guy: Man, she's hot

Second Guy: Whatever, you are so gay.

First Guy: C'mon, everyone knows you're the gay one

Second Guy: Hey, your mom's pretty masculine, but sleeping with her doesn't make me gay.

First Guy: Fag.

Second Guy: Ass pirate.

First Guy: Fudge packer

Second Guy: Cock jockey

First Guy: Cum dumpster.

(silent panel)

First guy: Okay, seriously, are you gay? Because if you've been holding out on me, we're missing out.

Second guy: No, it's cool.

First guy: OK me neither.
