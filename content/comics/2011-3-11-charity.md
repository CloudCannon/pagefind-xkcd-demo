Gamer: I'm going to buy this $10 game I want, and I'm donating $10 for malaria eradication.

Friend: If you actually cared, you'd skip the game and donate all $20.

Friend: What's more important? Games, or mosquito nets and medicine for kids?

Later:

Gamer: I think I'm going to buy these two $10 games I want.

Other Friend: Cool; which ones?
