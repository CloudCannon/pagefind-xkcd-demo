[Cueball holding his smartphone in both hands is talking to White Hat.]

Cueball: This new keyboard is like 30% faster! I'm never going back.

[White Hat replies and Cueball lifts his arms.]

White Hat: Good, put those years of horror behind you.

Cueball: C'mon. Sure, sometimes my focus on efficiency doesn't make sense. But we type a ***lot***.

[Cueball holding his smartphone in one hand while talking to White Hat.]

Cueball: That 30% improvement pretty quickly adds up to a *huge* amount of wasted time rescued.

[White hat replies and Cueball lifts one arm.]

White Hat: I just watched you open Google News and then close it without reading it ***five times in a row.***

Cueball: The fact that I spend most of my time so stupidly only makes it ***more*** important not to waste any here.
