[Randall, drawn as Cueball wearing a white face mask, possibly of the contour-moulded type, is talking to Cueball, wearing what appears to be a pleated surgical-style face mask .]

Randall: So how's...everything.

Randall: I mean, I know everything is, um...but are you, uh...

Randall: Sorry, I feel like the pandemic has destroyed my ability to have a conversation like a normal human.

Cueball: Haha, I know, right?
