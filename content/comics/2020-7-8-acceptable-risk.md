[All of the panels depict the same two characters seen from a long distance, making them difficult to recognize. However, they appear to be Cueball (on the left) and Ponytail (on the right). They are each wearing a mask.]

[Cueball and Ponytail talk to each other, standing at a distance:]

Cueball: Okay. Based on the local virus prevalence, our careful quarantines, and the steps we've taken to reduce transmission risk,

Cueball: I *think* it's okay for us to hang out.

Ponytail: I agree.

[Three small panels, vertically on top of each other]

[Cueball and Ponytail get closer to each other.]

[Cueball and Ponytail get still closer.]

[Cueball and Ponytail standing near each other:]

Cueball: Hi.

Ponytail: Hi.

[A normal sized panel, with Cueball and Ponytail standing near each other. They are yelling, with their arms raised:]

Cueball: *Is this social interaction good enough that it's worth risking our lives and the lives of others?!*

Ponytail: *I don't know!*

Cueball: *AAAAA!*

Ponytail: *AAAAAA!*

[Cueball and Ponytail stand much farther apart.]

Cueball: Healthy socializing was hard enough *before* the pandemic.

Ponytail: Let's just try again in 2021.
