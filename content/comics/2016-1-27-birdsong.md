  Maybe if I put it in a box for a while with a speaker playing some pleasant pastoral music, I can reprogram it.

[Cueball is walking and talking, while a bird, flying above him is singing, with four notes floating around it to indicate this. The notes are clearly above and removed from Cueball's text.]

Cueball (singing): The sun is shining, the birds are singingâ€”

[Cueball stops and looks up when the bird above him starts to sing using human language; four notes are floating around the text. The text of the bird's song is in italic text to indicate this.]

Bird (singing): Got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah

[Cueball looks down and black smoke emanates from the top of his head. The bird now flies above the panel but still sings in human language, four notes are floating below the text.]

Bird (singing - off-panel): Give me your heart, make it real

[Cueball is chasing the bird with a butterfly net, the bird is flying away from Cueball, continuing to sing, four notes are floating around the text.]

Bird (singing): Or else forget about it
