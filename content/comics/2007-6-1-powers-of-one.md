  It's kinda Zen when you think about it, if you don't think too hard.

{{Powers of One}}

{{A mind-expanding look at our world.}}

[[A sequence, presumably continuing endlessly in both directions, of identical images of a couple lying on a chequered blanket, with a picnic basket, on grass. Each image has a rule at the bottom giving measurements in meters, with the scale in terms of 1 to a particular power. The powers visible are the -1th (part), 0th-2nd, and 3rd (part).]]
