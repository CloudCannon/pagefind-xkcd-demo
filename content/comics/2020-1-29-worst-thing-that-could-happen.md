  Before I install any patch, I always open the patch notes and Ctrl-F for 'supervolcano', 'seagull', and 'garbage disposal', just to be safe.

[Ponytail is standing in front of a desk with a computer. One of her hands is on the keyboard. Behind her, Cueball, Hairy, and Megan are looking at the computer screen.]

Ponytail: We should upgrade.  What's the worst that could happen?

Cueball: Supervolcano.

Hairy: Robot uprising.

Megan: Everyone falls down a well at once.

[Zoom in on Cueball, Hairy, and Megan. Cueball has turned toward the other two.]

Cueball: Instead of hitting the tallest thing around, lightning starts hitting the nicest.

Megan: Seagulls all get handguns.

Hairy: A really ***slow*** nuclear war.

[Large panel with the original setting. Ponytail has turned towards the other three but is now facepalming, as Cueball gesturing with his hands at chest-height are still looking at the other two facing him.]

Cueball: We all have to go on a game show where they show you photos of people you've met once and ask you their names, and if you get one wrong a trapdoor opens and you fall into a garbage disposal.

Hairy: **Ooh,** that's a good one.

Megan: Yeah, let's put off the upgrade.
