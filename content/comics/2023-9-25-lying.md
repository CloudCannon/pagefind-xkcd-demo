[Cueball, Megan, Ponytail, and White Hat sit around a table.]

Cueball: It's me. I can't look you in the eyes and tell you it's not. I'm sorry, I know this ruins everything.

Cueball: I just need you to know that you're my friends and you can trust me.

Megan: ...This is ridiculous.

White Hat: Let's just play Taboo instead.
