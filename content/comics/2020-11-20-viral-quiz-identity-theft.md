[Hairy and White Hat are standing across from each other at a table.  Each has a laptop open in front of him.]

Hairy: Here's my plan: we start a viral quiz to trick people into posting the name of the street they lived on as a kid.

Hairy: Then we use it to steal their identity!

White Hat: Okay.

White Hat: Just checking, you know voter files and mortgages and stuff are mostly public records, right?

Hairy: Huh? What are you talking about?

White Hat: ...Nothing.  We can do your thing.
