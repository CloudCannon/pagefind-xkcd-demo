[Inside the main panel there is a frame with a Google location map with the typical red pin stuck in the center of the map inside a large gray region of the map. A river goes from the north through the gray region and out to the west. East and south of the river some roads and other items are shown, several of them also outside the gray region. The red pin is stuck next to a corner in one of the roads.]

[Below the map is the name of the location at the red pin, and below that there are three lines of unreadable text:]

<big>Canyon River Nuclear Launch Facility</big>

[Below that there is broken line with text in the break, and below that follows 11 reviews with yellow stars to the left. The stars are either just outlines or colored completely, with the left one always being filled:]

I love finding reviews of places that really don't need to have reviews.
