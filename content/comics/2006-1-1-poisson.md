[Cueball is talking to Black Hat. Cueball has his mouth wide open and has both of his arms up.]

Cueball: I'm a poisson distribution!

[Same scene, except Cueball has only one arm up.]

Cueball: Still a Poisson distribution!

Black Hat: what the hell, man. Why do you keep saying that?

[Cueball's face is gone, and he is not holding any arms up.]

Cueball: Because I'm totally a poisson distribution.

Black Hat: I'm less than zero.

[Cueball is gone. Black Hat is now whistling.]
