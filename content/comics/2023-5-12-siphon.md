[Cueball is standing next to two buckets while Megan is looking on from the other side of the buckets. The left bucket is on a stool and is almost filled with water while the other is on the ground and has a very small amount of water in it. Cueball is holding an empty tube between the two buckets. The end to the left is deep into the water in the left bucket while the other end hangs into the empty bucket to the right.]

Cueball: Wow, it's trueâ€”the water doesn't flow up the tube anymore.

Megan: Honestly, it's weird that it ever did.

Megan: Why did we think that was normal?
