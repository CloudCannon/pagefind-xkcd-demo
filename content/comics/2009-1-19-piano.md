[Cueball is holding a box with an open lid. A miniature piano is inside. Megan is looking at it]

Cueball: My hobby is making miniatures. Check this out — it's a fully-functional grand piano.

Megan: Whoa — beautiful.

[Cueball looks at the miniature piano.]

Cueball: Sadly, I've never heard what proper music sounds like on it—the keys are too small to play.

[Cueball closes lid to the piano.]

Cueball: I once asked a genie for someone who could play it for me, but I think he misheard.

Megan: ...are you doing anything later?
