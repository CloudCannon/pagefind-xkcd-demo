  The test didn't (spoiler alert) destroy the world, but the fact that they were even doing those calculations makes theirs the coolest jobs ever.

[[Three stick figures stand in front of a few graphs and scientific looking pictures. One of them has hair.]]

Los Alamos, 1945...

Middle Figure: We have a decision. If we've done our math right, this test will unleash heaven's fire and make us as gods.

Middle figure: But it's possible we made a mistake, and the heat will ignite the atmosphere, destroying the planet in a cleansing conflagration.

Left figure: Wow. Um. Question: Just to double-check - although I'm 99% sure -

Left figure: Is it "Soh cah toa" or "coh sah toa"?

Middle figure: Oh, for the love of... can someone redo Steve's work?

Right figure: I don't want to do the test anymore.
