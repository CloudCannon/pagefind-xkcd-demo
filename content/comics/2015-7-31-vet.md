[Megan arrives with a pet carrier, Cueball stands at a desk as a veterinarian, and Hairy is waiting behind a rope, standing next in line with a dog on a leash and a pet carrier.]

Megan: There's something wrong with my dog. He keeps crawling around eating dirt.

[Cueball takes out the contents of the carrier, revealing a Roomba, and Megan waits for Cueball's input. She is standing behind the desk with the carrier on the desk.]

Cueball: This is a Roomba.

Megan: Well, he's a mix.

Megan: Probably some Roomba in there.

[The Roomba now lies on the table next to the carrier between the two.]

Cueball: A Roomba is not a pet.

Megan: You're right. It's wrong to keep a beautiful creature like this in a house.

[Megan is outside left to a tree, arms up in the air, encouraging the Roomba to drive away.]

Megan: Go!

Megan: Be free!

Roomba: *Whirrr*
