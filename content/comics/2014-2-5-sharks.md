[Cueball is sitting on a throne, talking to a minion who's not shown in the panel.]

Minion: The prisoner escaped and is swimming toward the mainland!

Cueball: *Release the sharks.*

Minion: Yes, sir.

Minion: The sharks are swimming away.

Cueball: They're escaping, too? Send sharks after them!

Minion: Now *those* sharks are swimming away.

Cueball: ***More sharks.***

Minion: ...Sir, what's going on?

Cueball: Prisoners, of course! Can't let 'em escape!

Minion: Sir, are you trying to turn Doom Island into a marine biology center?

Cueball: *Shark populations are in declineâ€“*

Cueball: \*ahem\*

Cueball: I mean, the world must fear us!

Minion: Right...
