  The only other person to walk by was a linguist back in the 80s, but she just spent a while dissecting the phrase 'help me down' before getting distracted by a squirrel and wandering off.

[Megan and Beret Guy are walking through a landscape with spread-out trees and grass and puddles on the ground.]

Megan: Wow, this is all yours?

Beret Guy: Yeah! All the way back to the river!

Beret Guy: I walk here every day.

[Megan still walks towards Beret Guy who has now stopped and is looking up while speaking to a man hanging in a tree in front of them. The man has long wild hair and a large beard. He hangs from his parachute which has been folded around a large branch sticking out from beneath the top of the tree. He is holding a long stick of some sort, seemingly attempting to threaten Beret Guy, as the stick and his legs are vibrating as indicated with small lines.]

Beret Guy: Morning, Mister Cooper!

Cooper: You help me down ***this instant!***

[Pan down to show only Beret Guy and nothing else. Cooper replies from off-panel from the top corner.]

Beret Guy: Do you promise to give back all the money you took?

Cooper [off-panel]: ***Never!***

Beret Guy: Okay! See you tomorrow!

[Megan and Beret Guy continue walking through the landscape with three small trees behind them, as well as grass, rocks, and a small puddle. Megan looks back over her shoulder towards where Cooper is hanging.]

Megan: Was that D.B. Cooper?

Beret Guy: Yeah, and up ahead there's an owl nest!

Beret Guy: There's so much neat stuff here.
