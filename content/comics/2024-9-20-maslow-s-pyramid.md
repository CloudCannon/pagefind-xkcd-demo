  The local police, building inspector, and fire marshal are all contesting my 'safety' assertion, or would be if they could reach me past all the traps.

[The scene is seen from far away with the characters dwarfed by a huge pyramid in the middle of the panel. To the left we see Cueball facing White Hat and Megan while he is pointing behind him to the giant pyramid. It has been segmented into five tiers of equal height. Each tier has a labeled written on the side facing out. The segment at the tip is so small that the text needs to be written on two lines. To the right of each segment there is either a red cross (four times) or a green check mark (level two from the bottom). Next to these marks there is a comment. From top to bottom the labels, marks and comments are:]

Self-actualization

<font color="red">X</font> Honestly questioning my life choices here

Esteem

<font color="red">X</font> People seem less impressed by it than I hoped

Belonging and love

<font color="red">X</font> Friends are worried about me

Safety

<font color="green">âœ”</font> Highly defensible

Physiological needs

<font color="red">X</font> Provides basic shelter but no food, water, heat, etc

[Caption below the panel:]

I built Maslow's pyramid thing, but it's a total ripoff - it's only providing 20% of my needs.
