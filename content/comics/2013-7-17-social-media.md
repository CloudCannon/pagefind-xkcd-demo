[Cueball heads a press conference.]

Cueball: NASA has confirmed that the asteroid is heading directly for us.

Cueball: ...Yes, a question?

Reporter 1: What role has social media played in this asteroid's orbit?

Cueball: \**sigh*\*

Reporter 2: Has Twitter changed the way we respond to asteroid threats?

Cueball: Well, it's made the press conference questions stupider.
