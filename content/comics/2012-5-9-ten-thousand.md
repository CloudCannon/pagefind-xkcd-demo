  Saying 'what kind of an idiot doesn't know about the Yellowstone supervolcano' is so much more boring than telling someone about the Yellowstone supervolcano for the first time.

[Caption above the panel:]

I try not to make fun of people for admitting they don't know things.

[Caption right below said caption:]

Because for each thing "everyone knows" by the time they're adults, every day there are, on average, 10,000 people in the US hearing about it for the first time.

[A list of equations.]

Fraction who have heard of it at birth = 0%

Fraction who have heard of it by 30 ≈ 100%

US birth rate ≈ 4,000,000/year

Number hearing about it for the first time ≈ 10,000/day

[Caption above the next panel:]

If I make fun of people, I train them not to tell me when they have those moments.

And I miss out on the fun.

[Megan is standing. Cueball is walking, with his palm out.]

Megan: "Diet Coke and Mentos thing"? What's that?

Cueball: Oh man! Come on, we're going to the grocery store.

Megan: Why?

Cueball: You're one of today's lucky 10,000.
