[A flowchart is shown beneath its title:]

How to Calculate the "Heat Index":

[There are four boxes with arrows between. The first rectangular box is at the top, and an arrow points straight down:]

Measure the Temperature

[From there an arrow goes straight down to a decision diamond:]

Does it look hot enough?

[Two arrow goes out from the diamond. One goes straight down to another rectangular box. Both the arrow and the box has labels:]

No

Add a few degrees

[From the bottom box an arrow goes back to the diamond. The other arrow from the diamond goes right to a final box with no arrows. Again both the arrow and the box has labels:]

Yes

Done
