[This transcript only transcribes what can be seen in the first picture shown at the top of the explanation here. **For more** see link below.]

[One large frame with a five part comic and a large red button at the bottom.]

[Cueball sitting behind a desk.]

Cueball: We've made a huge mistake.

Desk: XKCD.COM

[Cueball stands and indicates a motley collection of computers and related equipment strewn around the desk.]

Cueball: I figured starting a cloud services company would be easy.

Cueball: After all, I've got *tons* of computers!

[A zoomed view on Cueballs head.]

Cueball: Facebook, Twitter, Tumblrâ€” they all struggle to protect privacy and user data...

Cueball: And ***we*** offered a solution.

Cueball: <small>I forget what it was, though.</small>

[Cueball is standing with his arms up.]

Cueball: Anyway, long story short, we screwed up *immediately* and lost *tons* of their data.

Cueball: <small>Also a bunch of stuff is literally on fire?</small>

[Cueball standing behind a desk.]

Cueball: We can fix this.

Cueball: But we need your help.

Desk: XKCD.COM

[Below the above is a large red rectangular clickable button, that will take the reader on to the interactive part of the comic. On the button it says in large white letters:]

**CLICK HERE**

To help us recover user data before Facebook & Co notice we lost it.
