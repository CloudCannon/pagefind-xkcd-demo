[There are three squirrels.  One is suspended from a balloon. The other two are sitting on the ground, looking up at it.]

Squirrel to the right: Once you've chewed a hole in the Sun, shoot the balloon to fall back to earth, then pull the parachute ripcord to land.

Squirrel tied to balloon: Are you ***sure*** it's full of acorns?

Squirrel to the right: Look how bright and magnificent it is! What *else* could be in there?
