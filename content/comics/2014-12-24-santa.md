[[Two characters are walking and talking.]]

Character: Say Santa eats a cookie at every few houses.  That's hundreds of tons.  By the end of the night, he should be a hulking seven-story behemoth.

Character: But he's not.

[[The characters stop and face one another.]]

Second character: What are you...

Character: Does Santa poop in our houses?

[[They continue to walk.]]

Second character: No way.

Character: That mass must be going somewhere.

Second character: He has that magic bag...

Character: You think he poops in the bag of 

presents

?

[[The second character gestures thoughtfully.]]

Second character: Maybe instead of pooping in every few houses, he waits, and then in a few houses, he poops a 

lot

.

Character: And what if no one's been 

that

 naughty?

Second character: He picks at random.  The needs of the many...
