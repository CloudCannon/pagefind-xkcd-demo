[Beneath two headings to the left and right are shown two aggressive-looking groups of people with only the four people in the front clearly shown for each group. Behind them five other people can be seen, but they are drawn in grey and are only partially shown behind the first four, and legs from all five in each group can be seen along with some of their heads.]

Left: Fashion Police

[From left to right, Hairy is holding one fist up to the left, Megan has her arms while crossed facing forward, a Cueball is holding a pole sign above his head with both hands facing a little to the left, displaying a single croc with a line through it and a circle around it, and another Cueball is holding a large stick to the right at head level. The person behind the rightmost Cueball has one fist raised, though not as high as Hairy.]

Right: Grammar Police

[From left to right, Megan is holding both fists above her head to the left, a Cueball is holding a sign much like the Cueball in the Fashion Police, although he is facing to the right and his sign has "Their", "They're", and "There" written on top of each other, Ponytail has one fist raised, facing left, and a bald man wearing glasses is holding a sword in his left hand facing right while his right palm is raised face up.]

[Below the two groups are eight points with bullets:]

\*Judgemental and smug

\*Angry about something deeply arbitrary

\*Strong opinions backed by style guides

\*Appreciate that the way that you are interpreted *is* your responsibility

\*Understand that there's no way to "opt out" of sending messages by how you present yourself, and attempts to do so send strong messages of their own

\*To seem cool and casual, pretend to ignore them while understanding them very well

\*Vindictive about things that are often uncomfortably transparent proxies for race or social class

\*Fun to cheer on until one of them disagrees with you

[Caption below the panel:]

I just realized these are literally the same people
