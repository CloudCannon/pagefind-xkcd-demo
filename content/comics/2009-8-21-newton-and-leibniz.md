[Newton with long white hair, facing right, holds up a sheet of paper, with several lines indicating the writing on it, in one hand and the other hand is also held up. He stands in front of an empty desk. A smaller frame breaking the border at the top of the frame has a caption:]

Newton, 1666

Newton: I've invented calculus!

[Leibniz with long black hair, facing left, holds up a sheet of paper, with several lines indicating the writing on it, in one hand. He stands in front of a desk with a book and two pieces of paper, one lying below the other paper but up above the book. A smaller frame breaking the border at the top of the frame has a caption:]

Leibniz, 1674

Leibniz: I've invented calculus!

[Back to a similar image of Newton, but he has now taken his arms down, still holding his paper.]

Newton: Really? Sounds a little bit...

[Zoom in on Newton as he puts on a pair of sunglasses in a panel without a frame. The table is not included.]

[Newton now with sunglasses on, again in front of the table.]

Newton: ...***Derivative.***
