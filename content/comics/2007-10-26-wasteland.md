[Cueball is walking through a wasteland talking to himself.]

Cueball: I am alone in this wasteland, a thousand miles from you.

Cueball: But I haven't forgotten the feel of your skin, your mischievous smile.

Cueball: You'd think a thousand miles would be enough.

Cueball: I guess I'll keep walking.
