[[Two guys are walking along together.]]

Man #1: I mean, let's be honest here--

Man #2: Ok. 

[[They stop walking and turn to face each other. Man #2 gestures with one hand.]]

Man #2: I don't understand why anything happens and I'm confused and scared and trying really hard all the time.

[[They stand facing each other.]]

Man #1: ...too honest. Scale it back.

Man #2: Sorry.
