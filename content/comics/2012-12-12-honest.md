[Two Cueballs are walking.]

Cueball: I mean, let's be honest here-

Friend: Ok.

[The friend is talking with his palm out.]

Friend: I don't understand why anything happens and I'm confused and scared and trying really hard all the time.

[The two Cueballs look at each other.]

Cueball: ...Too honest.

Cueball: Scale it back.

Friend: Sorry.
