  Plus, time's all weird in there, so most of it probably broke down and decomposed hundreds of years ago. Which reminds me, I've been meaning to get in touch with Yucca Mountain to see if they're interested in a partnership.

[Cueball looking at garbage chute attached to wardrobe. Black Hat answers him from off panel.]

Cueball: What's this thing on your wardrobe?

Black Hat (off-panel): Garbage chute.

[In a frame-less panel Cueball has turned away from the wardrobe (now off-panel) and he walks towards Black Hat.]

Cueball: Into a wardrobe?

Black hat: There's some sort of portal to a magical land in there. Half the furniture I get has them-it's kinda a pain.

[Cueball stops walking closer to Black Hat.]

Cueball: You dump your trash in Narnia?

Black Hat: Yeah, it's a real time-saver.

Black Hat: There's a huge cat in there, but I have a spray bottle I use when he tries to come up through the chute.
