  No way, we gotta rewind and cross-reference this map with the list of coordinates we saw on the other screen. This Greenland thing could be big.

What I pay attention to in movies:

[A pie chart with a small piece (5%) in the upper right part labeled:]

Plot, characters

[The rest of the chart (95%) is labeled:]

Computer screens shown briefly in the background

[Below the chart Cueball, sitting on the floor, and Hairy, sitting in an armchair, are watching a movie on the TV. Cueball points the remote at the TV.]

Cueball: Hang onâ€“ That blurry map behind the general shows one of the alien ships is in *Greenland*! Why ***Greenland?!***

Hairy [quietly]: Can we *please* just watch the movie?
