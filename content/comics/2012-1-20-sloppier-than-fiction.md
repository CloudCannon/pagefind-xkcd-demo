[A douchebag with a goatee and a bad haircut talks to Cueball while holding a drink.]

Goatee Guy: Even though it technically *wasn't* cheating, she dumped me anyway! So I tell Bret, and he's like "She sounds just like *my* crazy ex." And I was like, "dude, what was her name?" and it was the *same girl.*

Goatee Guy: I swear, if they made my life into a movie, no one would believe it.

Cueball: Yeah, though mostly because of the poorly-written dialogue and unlikeable main character.
