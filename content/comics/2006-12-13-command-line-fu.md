Cueball: Last night I was watching videos with this girl and my monitors kept turning off - even though I had disabled power save.

Friend: Odd.

Cueball: However! I wrote a command to jiggle the mouse pointer every couple minutes to keep it from going idle.

Friend: Not the first hack I'd try, but see? Linux has problems, but it gives you the tools to deal with them - and save your date!

Cueball: Actually, I was half an hour into the pointer scripting documentation when she got dressed and left.
