  You know that asteroid that almost destroyed Earth in the 90s? Turns out the whole thing was secretly created by Michael Bay, who then PAID Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck to look heroic while blowing it up!

[Cueball is holding a guitar and singing on a pier. Two pairs of connected eighth notes are on the left and right of Cueball, as well as a detached eighth note on his right. Three seagulls fly in the background on his left. Four pillars of the pier and the water below it are also shown. Throughout the comic, alternate pairs of lines of the song are indented as indicated below.]

Cueball:

The ship was the pride

of the American side

It was due to set

sail for Cleveland

As the big freighters go,

it was bigger than most

With a crew and good

captain well seasoned

[Zoom on Cueball facing to his right, still holding the guitar, without the pier, water, and seagulls. A pair of connected eighth notes to his right, a half note and a detached eighth note to his left.]

Cueball:

But taking a walk on

the shore by the dock

Was a songwriter named

Gordon Lightfoot

He was humming a tune

but it didn't have words

For it's challenging

trying to write good

[Close-up on Cueball's face. A quarter note and a pair of connected eighth notes to his right, a detached eighth note and a quarter note to his left.]

Cueball:

Poor Gordon sought glory

but needed a story

His career in folk

music imperiled

He mulled over this as

he watched them do work

On the hull of the

*Edmund Fitzgerald*

[Zoom back to second panel. Cueball is now facing to his left. A pair of connected eighth notes to Cueball's right, a separated eighth note and a pair of connected eighth notes to his left.]

Cueball:

Perhaps it was wrong,

what he did for a song

He should never have

bribed that mechanic

But his maritime crimes

are no worse than the time

Young James Cameron

sank the *Titanic*
