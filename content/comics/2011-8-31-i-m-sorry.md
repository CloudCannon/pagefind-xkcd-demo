[Megan and Cueball are standing next to each other having a conversation.]

Megan: My Mom's house burned down.

Cueball: Oh! I'm sorry!

Megan: Why? It's not *your* fault.

Cueball: It's nice of you to say that, but I know what I did.

[Caption below the panel:]

It annoys me when people interpret an obviously sympathetic "I'm sorry" as an apology, so I've started responding by making it one.
