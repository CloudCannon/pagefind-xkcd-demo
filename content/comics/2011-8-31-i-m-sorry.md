[[Two people are standing next to each other having a conversation.]]

Person 1: My Mom's house burned down.

Person 2: Oh! I'm sorry!

Person 1: Why? It's not 

your

 fault.

Person 2: It's nice of you to say that, but I know what I did.

It annoys me when people interpret an obviously sympathetic "I'm sorry" as an apology, so I've started responding by making it one.
