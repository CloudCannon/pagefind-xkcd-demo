  Oh yeah, I didn't even know they renamed it the Willis Tower in 2009, because I know a normal amount about skyscrapers.

[White Hat and Cueball are looking out on a skyline with six smaller skyscrapers and one much taller. The tall building has three plateaus, where it gets thinner before the top. On the top there are also two tall antennas, one twice as high as the other. Around the buildings there are 7 small clouds and two distant birds flying next tot he top of the tallest building. The two are standing on a ground behind a fence, maybe a viewing point, for looking in over the city skyline. They are looking toward the tallest building.]

White Hat: You know, back in the 90s, the Sears Tower was the world's tallest tower.

Cueball: Yeah! Or "building." The CN Tower and the KVLY-TV Antenna were taller, but the CN Tower isn't always considered a building and the antenna is supported by guy wires or whatever.

Whenever I get self-conscious about how obsessive I sound about some random topic, I panic and tack on "or whatever."
