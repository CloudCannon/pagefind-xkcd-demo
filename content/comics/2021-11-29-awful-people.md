  Hm, this burger place has a couple of good reviews, but LakeSlayer7 says he got food poisoning there and everyone should try this other place down by the lake instead.

[Cueball and Megan are having a conversation while walking.]

Cueball: The Internet makes it easy to be a jerk and forget the person we're talking to is a human.

Megan: Yeah...

Megan: But it also makes us see messages from awful people and assume they come from normal peers.

[Closeup on Megan. Above Megan is a picture of a "reply" post from a man with sunglasses. The post has a title above it.]

Megan: Recently I got a mean reply from a stranger. It was minor but it really got to me.

Post title: Replies to "Favorite Movie"

Post: Every group has one person who likes that movie, and it's the friend they all secretly hate.

[Blondie as a news anchor behind a desk. A "News4" logo is displayed on the desk. There is a picture of the man with sunglasses with "Arrested" under his name. His picture is next to a picture of a house with "Breaking" above it. Megan's dialogue appears above the picture, but she herself is not shown in this panel.]

Megan: Then the next week I saw that guy on the news. He was an actual murderer!

[Megan and Cueball standing next to each other.]

Megan: I can't believe I spent a week stressed out that my taste in movies wasn't shared by the East Valley Strangler.

Cueball: Yeah, at *least* wait for a second opinion from the Lake Slayer.
