  If I really focus, I can distinguish between John Steinbeck and John Updike, or between Gore Vidal and Vidal Sassoon, but not both at once.

[Megan is walking with a finger raised toward Cueball, who is seated in a chair with a book.]

Megan: Literary opinion:

Megan: I firmly believe that William S. Burroughs, Hunter S. Thompson, Chuck Palahniuk, and David Foster Wallace are different names for the same person.

Cueball: ...I see.

[Megan puts down her hand.]

Megan: *Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas* and *Fight Club*? Same book with different covers, I bet.

Cueball: I have both. Want to open them and check?

Megan: I do not.

[Cueball turns back to his book.]

Megan: Moving on: my next opinion--

Cueball: You should start a book club for discussing the books you refuse to read.

Megan: --is that E.B. White and T.H. White are the same person.

Cueball: Ok, *that* I believe.
