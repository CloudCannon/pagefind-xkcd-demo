  When my great grandfather designed the Titanic and it hit an iceberg and sank, he didn't sit around moping. He took those lessons to his next job designing airships, and he made the Hindenburg completely iceberg-proof!

[Black Hat is at a podium, addressing a crowd]

Black Hat: Was it a mistake to build turrets that can track nearby wireless devices and fire powerful lasers in their general direction?

Black Hat: Sure. I realize that now.

[Face-front view of Black Hat]

Black Hat: Was it a mistake to mount those turrets on neighborhood deer, release them, then lose interest in the project and move on?

Black Hat: Yes. Hindsight is 20/20.

[Close-up, Black Hat holds up his index finger]

Black Hat: But science is about learning from mistakes

Black Hat: And not being afraid to make new ones.

[Side view again]

Black Hat: Like inviting you here, but not warning you to put your phones in airplane mode.

Black Hat: Another mistake.

Black Hat: But that's okay.

Off-Panel: *Gallop gallop*

Audience member: *Is it really?!*

Black Hat: I think it's fine.

Deer: *Pew! Pew!*
