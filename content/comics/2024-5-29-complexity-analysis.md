[Cueball is holding a presentation pointer stick, pointing to a table behind him that towers above him. The table has a heading above it and then two columns and three rows. The first column is slim and the second much broader.]

[Table Heading]

Results of algorithm complexity analysis:

[Row 1]

Average case

O(n log n)

[Row 2]

Best case

Algorithm turns out to be unnecessary and is halted, then Congress enacts surprise daylight saving time and we gain an hour

[Row 3]

Worst case

Town in which hardware is located enters a Groundhog Day scenario, algorithm never terminates
