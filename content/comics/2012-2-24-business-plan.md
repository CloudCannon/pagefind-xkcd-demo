[[A person in a beret stands on a shoreline and takes the environment in in silent contemplation]]

[[The person heads off with an idea fresh in their head]]

[[The person saunters back with a jar, some bread, and a signboard]]

[[The person tears the bread off into pieces]]

[[The person sets up the signboard, with its contents yet to be revealed]]

[[The person heads off and waits for the plan to unfold]]

[[The same beach, this time with a couple walking past.  One person scratches their head with a "Whuh?" thought.  The bread has attracted quite a few birds.  The jar has a "$" on it.  The sign says: "Gulls for sale"]]
