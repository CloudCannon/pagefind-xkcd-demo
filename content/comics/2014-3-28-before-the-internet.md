[Young girl talking to Megan, both holding smartphones.]

Girl: Do you remember before the internet?

Megan: Oh yeah, totally.

Girl: what was it like?

Megan: Not having a phone or computer to distract you?

Girl: Yeah.

Megan: It was ***SO. BORING.*** All the time. I just ***sat*** there. It was the ***worst.***

Girl: But wasn't it, like, more fulfilling? Engaging?

Megan: Wasn't worth it.

Girl: *I* still get bored.

Megan: Not like we did.
