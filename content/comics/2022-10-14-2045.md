[Cueball, a friend also drawn as Cueball, Danish, and Black Hat are standing together. Danish is looking at her phone.]

Cueball: ...And then after the one in 2024, there's another on August 12, 2045.

Danish: I'll create an event. Do you think we'll still be using Google Calendar in 2045?

Black Hat: Sorry, I'd love to make it, but I have a thing that day.
