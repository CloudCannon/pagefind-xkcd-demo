[in a yellow box:]

Whenever I learn a new skill I concoct elaborate fantasy scenarios where it lets me save the day.

Megan: Oh no! The killer must have followed her on vacation!

[Megan points to computer.]

Megan: But to find them we'd have to search through 200 MB of emails looking for something formatted like an address!

Cueball: It's hopeless!

Off-panel voice: Everybody stand back.

Off-panel voice: I know regular expressions.

[A man swings in on a rope, toward the computer.]

*tap tap*

The word *PERL!* appears in a bubble.

[The man swings away, and the other characters cheer.]
