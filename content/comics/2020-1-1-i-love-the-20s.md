[Megan walks in from the left greeting Cueball, White Hat, and Ponytail standing next to each other, the last two looking in her direction.]

Megan: Happy new decade!

Ponytail: Welcome to the '20s!

White Hat: ***Actuallyâ€”***

Ponytail: I'm excited we can name decades again.

Ponytail: "Aughts" and "teens" never caught on.

[Megan stops next to Cueball as White Hat has his finger raised.]

White Hat: Actually, the new decade doesn't start-

Ponytail: Mostly, I'm just glad we can go back to attributing cultural trends to decades instead of generations.

[All four just stand normal.]

Cueball: Yeah.

Cueball: Decades were silly, but making everything about "millennials" turned out to be even worse.

Ponytail: Seriously.

[Only White Hat and Ponytail are shown, both with their arms held out to the sides, with White Hats's arms more relaxed than Ponytail's.]

White Hat: It's technically not a new decade until 2021.

Ponytail: OK, listen.

Ponytail: If you're going to be pedantic, you should at least be right.

White Hat: I ***am*** right!

Ponytail: You're ***not***.

[Zoom in on White Hat and Ponytail's upper bodies as they gesture towards each other both raising their hands, palm up. Megan interrupts them from off-panel, as made clear in the next panel. Her voice comes out of a starburst on the left panel frame.]

White Hat: See, the 20<sup>th</sup> century didn't start until--

Ponytail: But decades aren't centuries. They're not cardinally numbered.

White Hat: You don't get it. Let me draw a--

Ponytail: No, ***you*** don't--

Megan (off-panel): Stop!

[All four characters are displayed again. Megan has raised a finger and all the others look at her.]

Megan: I can resolve this.

Megan: \*Ahem\*

Megan: MC Hammer's *U Can't Touch This* (1990) was featured in ***I Love the '90s***, not *** '80s***.

Ponytail: ...That settles that.

White Hat: Yeah, I accept VH1's authority.

White Hat: You win.
