[Cueball is presenting in front of a poster, which he is pointing at with a stick.

The poster shows Saturn and its ring-system. There is a massive football/soccer ball drawn inside the semi-transparent planet, taking up slightly less than half of it by volume. One of the ball's hexagons coincides with Saturn's polar hexagon, and is labelled "Hexagon". Other labels are illegible.

The poster's title is "There's a Big Soccer Ball In There". The rest of the poster is illegible, except for a section heading that reads "BSBIT Model".]

Cueball: We're proud to announce that our team has finally determined the origin and nature of Saturn's polar hexagon.
