[Cueball is standing behind Megan who sits at a desk typing on her laptop.]

Cueball: So how do we regulate all these micro drones?

Cueball: I mean, Amazon delivery bots sound cool...

[Cueball stands alone surrounded by three micro drones.]

Cueball: But I worry that overnight we'll realize we're surrounded by these things, no one will know who's controlling them, and then *bam*, sci-fi dystopia.

[Megan turns in her chair towards Cueball.]

Megan: If you wanna slow it down, why not just remove all regulations, but then make drone theft legal?

[Cueball takes his hand to his chin and Megan turns back to type on the laptop.]

Cueball: ...I *like* that.

Megan: You write to congress.

Megan: I'll stock up on butterfly nets.
