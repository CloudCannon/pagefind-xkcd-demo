[Cueball is sitting in an office chair at a desk typing on his laptop as Megan walks in.]

Cueball: I built another COVID exposure model to help me limit my risk.

[Megan stands behind Cueball, who has turned in his chair to face her. He is leaning his arm on the back of the chair.]

Megan: Any new insights?

Cueball: Yeah: "If you spend all day debugging models, you don't have close contact with a lot of people."

[Cueball turns away from Megan to type on his laptop again. The back of his chair has disappeared.]

Megan: Well, I guess it worked.

Cueball: According to my meta-model, the end of the pandemic is only four more models away.

Megan: So close!
