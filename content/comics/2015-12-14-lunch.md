[Cueball to the right and his Cueball-like friend to the left sits behind a table. Visible on the table between them are a loaf of bread, a glass with some liquid in it, an oblong box with a readable label and a small heap of small grains.]

Friend: What're you having for lunch?

Cueball: The usualâ€”half a pound of cheese, white bread, a glass of tomato sauce, and some salt.

Friend: Eww.

Label on the box: Cheese
