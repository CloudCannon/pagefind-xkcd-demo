[Cueball is sitting at a desk with a laptop, looking at a review website]

Cueball: What's with this negative review? You *liked* that hotel.

Black Hat: I have a script that posts a bad review for every hotel I stay at. It reduces demand, which means more vacancies and lower prices next time.

Cueball: What if the place sucks?

Black Hat: I change the review to positive to steer other people over there.

Cueball: You punish companies you like!

Black Hat: The odds of *my* review putting a hotel out of business are negligible.

Cueball: If we all did that the system would collapse!

Black Hat: Doesn't affect my logic. Tragedy of the commons.

Cueball: That's not even the tragedy of the commons anymore. That's the tragedy of you're a dick.

Black Hat: If you're quick with a knife, you'll find that the invisible hand is made of delicious invisible meat.
