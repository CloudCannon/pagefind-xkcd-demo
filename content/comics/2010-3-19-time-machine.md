[[Rob is working at a workbench. Future-Rob appears out of nowhere with a baseball bat.]]

Future-Rob: Hi, Rob.

Rob: Whoa, you're me!

Future-Rob: You're about to have an idea for a time machine.

Rob: I am?

[[Future-Rob hits Rob over the head with the baseball bat.]]

<<WHAM>>

[[A friend approaches Future-Rob working at the workbench. The baseball bat is stashed behind it.]]

Friend: Hey, Rob. What's up?

Future-Rob: Nothing.

This happens somewhere roughly once a month.
