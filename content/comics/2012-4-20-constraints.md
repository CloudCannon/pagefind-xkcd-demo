[Cueball sits in an office chair at his computer desk, motioning toward the screen with a hand as Megan stands behind him.]

Cueball: I don't get why authors and comedians spend so much energy trying to be clever on Twitter. Couldn't they put that creativity into more books and scripts?

Cueball: Is there something they *like* about the 140-character format?

Megan: Yeah. Writers working under tight restrictions produce novel materialâ€”like, for example, epigrams employing backward alphabetization.

[A slim panel with only Cueball at his computer desk shown.]

Cueball: ...Whoa.
