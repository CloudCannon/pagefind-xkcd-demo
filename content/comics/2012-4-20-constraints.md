[[A man sits at his computer desk, motioning toward the screen as a woman stands behind him.]]

Man: I don't get why authors and comedians spend so much energy trying to be clever on Twitter. Couldn't they put that creativity into more books and scripts? -- Is there something they 

like

 about the 140-character format?

[[Same picture, only the man has his arm down.]]

Woman: Yeah. Writers working under tight restrictions produce novel material -- like, for example, epigrams employing backward alphabetization.

[[The man remains at his computer desk. The woman is no longer in the frame.]]

Man: ...whoa.
