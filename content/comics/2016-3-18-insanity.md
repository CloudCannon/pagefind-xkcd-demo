  I looked up "insanity" in like 10 different dictionaries and none of them said anything like that. Neither did the DSM-4. But I'll keep looking. Maybe it's in the DSM-5!

[Cueball is walking towards the right of the panel with White Hat walking behind him holding a finger up as to make a point.]

White Hat: They say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.

Cueball: You've been quoting that clich√© for years. Has it convinced anyone to change their mind yet?
