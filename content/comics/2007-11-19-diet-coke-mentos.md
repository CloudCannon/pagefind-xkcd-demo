[[Two boys are kneeling down on either side of a coke bottle.]]

First Boy: This is the coolest thing.

First Boy: You just drop the Mentos in the Diet Coke...

Second Boy: Uh huh

First Boy: Give it a moment...

[[The bottle has a few bubbles above it]]

<<Poof>> [[A man appears.  The first boy raises his arms in exclamation.]]

[[The second boy stands up and turns around.  He puts his hands over his mouth.]]

Second boy: D-Dad?

Man [[Reaching towards the second boy]]: I'm back, son. We can be a family again.
