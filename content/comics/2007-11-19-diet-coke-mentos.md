[Cueball and his friend are sitting on the ground, with a bottle of Diet Coke between them, and Cueball appears to be putting mentos into the bottle.]

Cueball: This is the coolest thing. You just drop the Mentos in the Diet Coke...

Friend: Uh huh.

[Diet Coke starts to fizzle.]

Cueball: Give it a moment...

[Someone teleports into frame in a magic puff. Cueball's arms are raised, with a package of Mentos in one hand.]

*POOF*

Friend: D-Dad?

Dad: I'm back, son. We can be a family again.
