[Cueball stands in front of a bookshelf.]

Cueball: Ooh, *Atlas Shrugged*.

[Cueball yanks out book only for a click to be heard.]

[The entire setup begins to rumble, while the bookcase and a surrounding platform takes both it and Cueball behind the wall.]

[The tiny, dark room behind the wall has one thing painted on it.]

Wall: You have terrible taste.

[The whole piece of kit moves back to its original position. Cueball stands there mildly stunned.]
