[Two guys, both Cueball-like, are standing at a cliff's edge.]

Friend: What time is it?

[Cueball looks at his watch in silence.]

[Cueball looks up.]

Cueball: Now.

[The full scene is shown: the two men (barely visible) are standing at the lip of a huge canyon in a rocky, barren landscape. A pock-marked moon and a ringed planet are visible in the burgundy-colored sky.]

[The two guys are again seen standing at what is now known to be the lip of the canyon.]

Friend: That's a pretty boring answer.

[Same scene as before.]

Cueball: Is not.

[Same scene.]

Cueball: It's the least boring answer imaginable.
