[Two Cueballs sit at a table across from each other, typing on their laptops.]

Cueball: Another urban legend? You should check out Snopes before sending me this stuff.

Friend: Oops; yeah.

Cueball: Man, Snopes is really great--independent fact-checkers trawling our collective discourse, filtering out misinformation.

Cueball: That's absurd. Plus, it's definitely not true--it was debunked by...

Friend: Yes?

Cueball: ...Oh my God.
