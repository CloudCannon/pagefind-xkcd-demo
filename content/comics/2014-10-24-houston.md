Orbiter transmission: Houston, we have a problem

[Cueball with a headset sits at a computer desk with two monitors.]

Cueball: Cool.

[We see a close-up of Cueball.]

Orbiter transmission: ...What? Houston, we stirred our Oâ‚‚ tank and it *exploded*!

Cueball: Sounds like you suck at stirring.

[We see the orbiter in space, far from the planet.]

Orbiter transmission: ...Houston? Are you-

Cueball: Listen, I've got another call. Good luck landing your airplane or whatever.
