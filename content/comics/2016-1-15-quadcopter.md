[[A figure holding a phone is talking to a woman.]]

Figure: Magnus Carlsen has an app where you can play chess against a simulated version of him at different ages. I can beat the 8Â½-year-old, but lose to him at 9. 

Woman: I want that, but for other games. Can I beat 8-year-old Serena Williams at tennis? Swim laps faster than a 6-year-old Michael Phelps? 

Figure: We should make a simulator. 

Figure: ...Why limit it to games? Can I cook a better chicken than 11-year-old Martha Stewart? 

Woman: Win an election against 12-year-old JFK? 

[[The figures are sitting at laptops, with a stack of books between them.]]

Soon...

Woman: Looks like 8-year old Magnus Carlsen can swim faster than 9-year-old Martha Stewart. 

Figure: But they both lose a hot-dog-eating contest to 2-year-old Secretariat. 

Woman: This project has gotten weird.
