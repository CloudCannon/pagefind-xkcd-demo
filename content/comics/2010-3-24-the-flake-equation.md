  Statistics suggest that there should be tons of alien encounter stories, and in practice there are tons of alien encounter stories. This is known as Fermi's Lack-of-a-Paradox.

The Flake Equation:

P = W<sub>P</sub> × (C<sub>R</sub> + M<sub>I</sub>) × T<sub>K</sub> × F<sub>0</sub> × F<sub>1</sub> × D<sub>T</sub> × A<sub>U</sub> ≈ 100,000

Where:

W<sub>P</sub> = World Population (7,000,000,000)

C<sub>R</sub> = Fraction of people who imagine an alien encounter because they're crazy or want to feel special (1/10,000)

M<sub>I</sub> = Fraction of people who misinterpret a physical or physiological experience as an alien sighting (1/10,000)

T<sub>K</sub> = Probability that they'll tell someone (1/10)

F<sub>0</sub> = Average number of people they tell (10)

F<sub>1</sub> = Average number of people each friend tells this "firsthand" account (10)

D<sub>T</sub> = Probability that any details not fitting the narrative will be revised or forgotten in retelling (9/10)

A<sub>U</sub> = Fraction of people with the means and motivation to share the story with a wider audience (blogs, forums, reporters) (1/100)

Even with conservative guesses for the values of the variables, this suggests there must be a *huge* number of credible-sounding alien sightings out there, available to anyone who wants to believe!
