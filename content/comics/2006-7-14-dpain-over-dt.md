Will it ever stop hurting?

dPain

dt = (-k_1 Pain + [Image of girl]) (1 

 (1 + e ^ -(t - k_2)

d))

k_1=?

k_2=?

[Image of girl]=How much she's still in my life

Please let d only be a few days... or weeks

I guess there's some kind of a cutoff after years, where it stops mattering and we can be friends. Do I _want_ that?

Is k_1 positive? Is k_2 large?

Will I ever stop feeling like this?
