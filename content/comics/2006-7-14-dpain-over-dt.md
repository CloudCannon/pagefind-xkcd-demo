dPain/dt = (-k<sub>1</sub> Pain + [Image of Megan]) (1/(1 + e ^ -(t-k<sub>2</sub>)/d))

*k*<sub>1</sub>=?

*k*<sub>2</sub>=?

[Image of Megan]=How much she's still in my life

Please let *d* only be a few days... or weeks

I guess there's some kind of a cutoff after years, where it stops mattering and we can be friends. Do I <u>want</u> that?

Is *k*<sub>1</sub> positive? Is *k*<sub>2</sub> large?

Will I ever stop feeling like this?
