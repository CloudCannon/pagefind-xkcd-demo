Grey on white diagram of the Earth orbiting the Sun, not to scale.  Earth is depicted as a circle with pale grey continents on darker grey seas, and shows a view from above the North Pole without any Arctic ice. The sun is drawn surrounded by radially symmetrical exaggerated wave pattern.

Also in grey, approximate locations of Lagrange points 1 to 5 are marked with dots and labels: "L<sub>1</sub>" "L<sub>2</sub>" "L<sub>3</sub>" "L<sub>4</sub>" "L<sub>5</sub>".

In black, a point on the Earth's surface within the boundary of a continent that could be North America. Also in black, an arrow pointing towards the point, and the label "L<sub>6</sub>".
