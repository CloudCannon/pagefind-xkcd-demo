[Ponytail stands facing Cueball and Megan in front of a poster board.]

[Ponytail is pointing a stick to the board reading "Current List" with bullet points beneath.]

[The first bullet reads Influenza B/Yamagata.]

[Four further bullet points follow, which are left indistinct.]

Ponytail: Influenza's genetic diversity has declined during the pandemic, and the B/Yamagata lineage is at risk of extinction.

Ponytail: Which would be *such* a shame.

Megan: Yeah, I'm sooooooo worried about it.

Cueball: We'd be just *heartbroken!*
