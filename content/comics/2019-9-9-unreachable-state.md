[Cueball, sitting on an office chair at his desk with his hands over his laptop computer. There is an error message on the screen which is displayed above him with a zigzag line from the screen to the text. The exclamation mark at the top is shown in white on a black triangle.]

! Error

If you're seeing this, the code is in what I thought was an unreachable state.

I could give you advice for what to do. But honestly, why should you trust me? I clearly screwed this up. I'm writing a message that should never appear, yet I know it will probably appear someday.

On a deep level, I know I'm not up to this task. I'm so sorry.

Never write error messages tired.
