[Megan holding a flashlight and standing behind Cueball, who is sitting at a computer.]

Megan: Our bathroom looks pretty clean, right?

Cueball: I think so. Why?

Megan: I got a UV flashlight. Come look.

[Cueball leaves the computer; they walk.]

[Megan and Cueball are off-screen.]

Cueball: Looks fine.

UV flashlight: \*Click\*

 \*Click\*

Cueball: ...Oh my God.

[Megan and Cueball walking in the opposite direction; Cueball is looking back behind him.]

Cueball: The toilet looked like the guy's chest after the alien burst out.

Megan: What do we ***do?***

[Megan and Cueball standing.]

Cueball: We clean. Clean and clean and never stop.

Megan: It won't be enough. We should just burn the place down for the insurance money.

[Cueball standing behind Megan. Megan is pouring a liquid onto the floor out of a red-colored canister labled "Danger".]

Cueball: Isn't that wrong?

Megan: My morality has evaporated under the harsh UV light.

[Megan and Cueball standing outside the burning building.]

[Megan and Cueball standing, Cueball looking at his phone.]

Cueball: OK, I'm Googling insurance companies. Which one do you think pays the most?

Megan: Let's just try calling around.
