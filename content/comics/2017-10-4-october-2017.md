[Megan and Cueball are walking.]

Megan: Want to feel old?

Cueball: Why do you always start your factoids that way? Of course I don't want to feel old. I already feel old.

[Slim beat panel where they keep walking.]

[In a frame-less panel only Cueball is shown walking.]

Cueball: ...Fine, hit me.

[Megan holds her hand up as they again are shown walking together. Cueball balls his hands up into fists in response to her comment.]

Megan: If you broke a mirror back when the Aaron Sorkin Facebook movie came out, your seven years of bad luck would be over this week.

Cueball: Dammit.
