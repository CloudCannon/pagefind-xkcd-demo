[An open wardrobe, with a boat anchor attached to one corner, falling towards water.]

[Below the water line a formula with its variables explained is shown:]

Q = A \* sqrt(2 \* g \* d)

Q = flow rate

A = area of opening

d = ocean depth (2&nbsp;km)

g = Earth gravity

[And below the formula:]

Flow: ~400,000 <sup>liters</sup>/<sub>s</sub>

Water jet velocity: ~200 <sup>m</sup>/<sub>s</sub>

The White Witch didn't know what hit her.
