[Cueball and Megan stand facing one another.]

Megan: Why didn't you wait for me?

Cueball: I thought you were gone forever!

[Megan throws out her arms, and Cueball is looking down.]

Megan: I said I'd be back in a minute!

Cueball: The... the seconds went fast at first, but then they started to drag on.

Cueball: She was there for me.

[Same scene as before, except Megan has her arms out less.]

Megan: You had an affair in the 90 seconds I was gone?!

Cueball: ...yes.

[Cueball and Megan stand facing one another in a smaller panel.]

Cueball: And we had a son.

[Same scene as before.]

Cueball: He'd be about your age now.
