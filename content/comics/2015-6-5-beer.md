[Cueball and Hairy standing in front of a fridge.]

Hairy: What do you drink? Stouts? Lagers?

Cueball: Uh, anything's fine.

[Cueball and Hairy holding beers and Hairy is drinking.]

Cueball: ...do you ever think maybe we should just admit that all beer tastes kind of bad and everyone's just pretending?

[Now Cueball drinks.]

Hairy: Man, you are *no* fun at all.

Cueball: Ok, got it. Not a word.

Hairy: Dude, if you don't like it, don't drink it.

Cueball: No, no, gotta do my part! Mmmmm!!!
