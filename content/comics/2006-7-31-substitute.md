[In a classroom, the board says "Math" on the top-left corner, and "Mr. Munroe" in the middle. A Cueball portrays Randall, standing in front of it, speaking to the class.]

Randall: Miss Lenhart couldn't be here today, so she asked me to substitute.

Randall: I've put out your tests. Please get started.

[A student in the first row raises the exam paper and says:]

Student: Mr. Munroe, Miss Lenhart never taught us this.

Randall: That's because Miss Lenhart doesn't understand how important certain kinds of math are.

Student: But this just looks--

Randall: This material is more vital than anything you've ever learned

Student: But--

Randall: No buts.

Randall: This is a matter of life and death.

[Excerpt from the exam paper.]

<tt>Name: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_</tt>

[A stick figure is standing, hands over head. A velociraptor is running towards it.]

<tt>1. The velociraptor spots you 40 meters away and attacks, accelerating at 4 m/s^2 to its top speed of 25 m/s. When it spots you, you begin to flee, quickly reaching your top speed of 6 m/s. How far can you get before you're caught and devoured?</tt>

<tt>2. You're at the center of a 20m equilateral triangle with a raptor at each corner. The top raptor has a wounded leg and is limited to a top speed of 10 m/s.</tt>

[A stick figure is shown in the above situation. The picture has a legend "<tt>(Not to scale).</tt>"]

<tt>The raptors will run toward you. At what angle should you run to maximize the time you stay alive?</tt>

<tt>3. Raptors can open doors, but they are slowed by them. Using the floor plan on the next page, plot a route through the building, assuming raptors take 5 minutes to open the first door and halve the time for each subsequent door. Remember, raptors run at 10 m/s and they do not know fear.</tt>
