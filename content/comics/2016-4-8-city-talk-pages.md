  I don't think the Lakeshore Air Crash Museum really belongs under 'Tourist Attractions.' It's not a museum--it's just an area near the Lake Festival Laser Show where a lot of planes have crashed.

I love reading the Wikipedia talk pages for articles on individual cites

[A list of contents for a Wikipedia talk page regarding an article about a city. Except for the header and the square brackets, which are written in black text, the rest is in a blue font.]

Contents [<font color="#0746ad">hide</font>]

<div style="color:#0645ad;">

1 Origin of city's name?

1.1 Idea for a better name

1.2 Not how Wikipedia works

2 Too much promotion of the lake festival

3 Should we mention the murders?

3.1 Not that notable

3.2 All cites have murders

4 Quote verification:  Even if Voltaire did visit (unlikely), why would he get so angry about our restaurants?

5 Discuss:  New picture

5.1 Current one looks awfully bleak

5.2 Gray sky

5.3 What about this

5.4 Also bleak

5.5 Maybe this place just looks that way

5.6 Found a better picture, more colorful

5.7 That's a shot from Disney's *Zootopia*

6 "Mining disasters" section too long

6.1 Not really Wikipedia's fault

6.2 Why is this town so bad at mining?

7 Infobox picture:  I just realized you can see a murder happening in the background

7.1 This city is terrible

7.2 Photoshopped out murder

7.3 Can someone just take a better picture

7.4 Okay, uploaded a new picture

7.5 Wait, never mind, I just noticed there's a murder in this one, too

8 1982 secession still in effect?

9 I think the murderer is reverting my edits

10 Why does this article take ***any*** position on correct condom use, let alone such a weird and ambiguous one?

11 Train station "Designed by Andrew Lloyd Webber"?

11.1 They probably mean Frank Lloyd Wright

11.2 I thought so too, but it's apparently not a mistake

11.3 Didn't know he did architecture

11.4 Roof collapse
