  I mean, it wasn't exactly MY thesis. When the FAA came to shut down our observatory for using the telescope mirror to shine light at airplanes, I took a thesis and a bunch of doctorates from the supply cabinet on my way out.

[In a dark panel, Megan is a TV host standing in front of a group of 5 people: two Cueballs, Ponytail, Hairbun and a Megan-like woman.]

Host: Welcome back to stargazing.

Host: When the stars disappeared this morning, I figured I had to find a new job, but they're back! This rules!

[A frame-less white panel in which the host points to the upper right with the Megan-like woman, Ponytail and Cueball looking in that direction.]

Host: Those three stars form a constellation called the triangle.

Host: Those three are another triangle.

Host: Lotta triangles. Very important shape.

[Back to a dark panel with the host now pointing to the upper left in a close-up.]

Host: Those dots are planets, or "fool's stars." Without interstellar travel, they're the only ones we can realistically hope to dump trash on.

Host: Speaking of space trash, that dot is a satellite. There are apps that will tell you whose fault it is.

[The host is now turned right not pointing, still in a close-up.]

Off-panel voice: What's that blinking one?

Host: Airplane. They're full of snacks and money and stuff, but don't bother trying to catch them- they're way too high up.

Host: Learned that the hard way in grad school.

Host: Got a thesis out of it, at least.
