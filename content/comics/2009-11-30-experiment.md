[Darkness.]

[Cueball is standing next to a laptop, looking groggy.]

Cueball: Ugh...

Cueball: What happened?

[Cueball begins to regain some awareness, with his speech eventually fading out.]

Cueball: Where am I?

*FWOOOOOOSH*

Cueball: Help! Someone help me (unintelligible speech due to loss of air in dome)

[Cueball holds his hands to his mouth.]

[Cueball looks shocked.]

[Cueball tries to run, but has no traction against the ground.]

[Cueball falls down.]

[Cueball lies prone and motionless.]

[Black Hat and Danish watching from outside the dome, with Black Hat holding a clipboard as if to take notes.]

[Black Hat and Danish outside the dome. Black Hat is now holding the clipboard down to his side.]

Black Hat: Huh. Looks like physics professors don't like working in frictionless vacuums after all.

Danish: They're such liars.
