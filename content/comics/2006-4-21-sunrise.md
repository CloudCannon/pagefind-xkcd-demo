  Sometimes, I sit on top of parking decks and watch the sun rise. I feel like I should have a guitar or something.

[Hairy is on the street. Behind him is a house with a lawn.]

Hairy (thinking): I love the time just before sunrise. It's quiet; no one is ever just walking about.

Hairy (thinking): It's like a secret

Hairy (thinking): I always hope that I'll find someone else quietly hiding from sleep, and we'll see each other and sit and talk.

Hairy (thinking): I guess this is a bad place to meet people.

Hairy (thinking): I wish it weren't.

[Hairy goes into the house, brushes his teeth, shaves his head (?), and leaves the house again.]

[Hairy is at a club, disco balls in the ceiling and a giant woofer. Many people are dancing around him.]
