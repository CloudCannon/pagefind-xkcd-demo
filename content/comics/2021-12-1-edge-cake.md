[Megan is walking towards Cueball and Emily (who resembles Hairbun), holding a cake.]

Megan: Happy birthday, Emily!

Cueball: Wait, wasn't that last month? When's your birthday, anyway?

Emily: It's complicated.

[A diagram of a flight path over the North Pole, with meridian lines radiating out from the center. Emily's dialogue appears above the diagram, but she herself does not appear in this panel.]

Emily: My mom went into labor on an arctic international flight that diverted directly over the North Pole.

Emily: I was born in every time zone at once.

[With Megan standing behind her, Emily holds out a plate of cake to Cueball.]

Emily: It was also February 29th, and the airline was just changing ownership between countries.

Emily: The International Bureau of Weights and Measures finally issued a declaration that it's my birthday whenever I want.

Emily: Cake?

Cueball: Nice, it's all edge pieces.
