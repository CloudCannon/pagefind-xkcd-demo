[[Student before a professor]]

Student: How can I pick a major? I'm interested in everything! Can't I major in "the universe"?

Professor: Okay. First, I'll need papers on every European trade summit that did not result in an agreement. Then, spend a year memorizing every microprocessor instruction set ever used in a production chip.

[[Student scratches head]]

Student:What I meat was I just want to read Malcolm Gladwell books and drink.

Professor: We all do, sweetie.
