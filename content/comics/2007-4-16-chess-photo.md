[Cueball sits at a desk with glue, chess pieces, and a chessboard, while his Cueball-like friend looks over his shoulder.]

Friend: What are you doing?

Cueball: Gluing down chess pieces.

Friend: Why?

Cueball: Because there's a picture I've always wanted... I'll need your coat to sneak this onto the ride.

[A photograph of a roller coaster ride with Cueball sitting in the first car, chin in hand, thinking over the chessboard and the rest of the people screaming with their hands up. The photograph has "Mega Coaster 3000 souvenir photo" written on the bottom margin.]
