Cueball: Did you ever figure out those mysterious woodchips?

Hairbun: The ones in the hallway? No.

Cueball: You didn't suspect that they matched the timber used in 1861 to build the "ghost ship" Mary Celeste, prompting you to send them to a lab for analysis, the results of which raised new and stranger questions?

Hairbun: No, I threw them out. Why?
