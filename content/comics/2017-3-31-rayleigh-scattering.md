  If you ask "why are leaves green?" the usual answer is "because they're full of chlorophyll, and chlorophyll is green," even though "why does chlorophyll scatter green light?" is a great question too.

[Jill asks Blondie a question which she answers while lifting her arm towards Jill.]

Jill: Why is the sky blue?

Blondie: Because air is blue.

[Megan walks in from behind Jill.]

Megan: No, the sky is blue because of Rayleigh scattering–

Blondie: Nah, it's because air is blue. Blue light bounces off it and hits our eyes. Same as why anything is any color.

[Zoom in on Blondie's face.]

Blondie: It's why far-off mountains look blue – because of all the blue air in the way.

[Zoom out to Megan standing longer from Jill than Blondie who has thrown her arms out. Jill is facing directly out towards the reader.]

Megan: There's a specific quantum mechanism by which–

Blondie: Yeah but there's a physics mechanism for *every* color. You don't have to get all quantum right away.

[Frameless panel with Jill looking up at Blondie who stands holding her hands on her sides. Megan speaks from off-panel.]

Megan (off-panel): ...OK, I guess.

Blondie: Any other questions?

Jill: How do planes stay up?

[Blondie holds a finger up in front of Jill while Megan now is the one to throw out her arms.]

Megan: Well, the airflow–

Blondie: Tiny birds in the wings. Thousands. Flapping hard.

Jill: WOW!

Megan: *NO!*
