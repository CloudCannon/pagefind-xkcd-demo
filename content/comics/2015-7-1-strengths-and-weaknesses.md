  Do you need me to do a quicksort on the whiteboard or produce a generation of offspring or something? It might take me a bit, but I can do it.

[Ponytail is shown sitting on a swivel chair, to the left of a desk.]

Ponytail: What would you say is your biggest weakness?

[The view expands to show Cueball sitting on another swivel chair, on the opposite side of the desk.]

Cueball: Probably that I'm a giant tangle of parts that don't always work right, so I can die easily.

Ponytail: Biggest strength?

Cueball: There will come a day when I'm either an ancestor to *all* living humans, or to *none* of them.

Ponytail: Where do you see yourself in five years?

Cueball: Probably not the ancestor of all living humans yet. But you never know!
