[Warzone. A soldier in modern American combat gear holding a rifle turns to face Cueball, who is wearing an ersatz copy of the same uniform and clutching a wooden rifle. There is a artillery shell flying through the air and rubble in the backround]

Sound effect: *BLAM BLAM*

Sound effect: ***KABOOM***

Soldier: Will you *please* stop imitating everything I do?

Cueball: Will you *please* stop...

My Hobby: real time war reenactment.
