[Ponytail and Jill are walking together.]

Ponytail: I can't imagine anyone who grew up on the Internet being able to run for President.

[Closeup of Jill.]

Jill: Why? Because it'd mark the handover of a world that no longer needs you to a generation you don't understand?

[Ponytail and Jill have stopped walking and are facing each other.]

Jill: ...Or because there would be embarrassing pictures of us as teenagers?

[Closeup of Ponytail.]

Ponytail: Um. The pictures one?

Jill (off-screen): Pictures of teens! How will we even survive??
