[Cueball is standing in front of a large combination washing machine/dryer, holding a coat, wondering.]

Cueball: Okay, do I want "Colors (light)" or "Delicate"? Does delicate mean less agitation? Or a slower spin?

Cueball: I should Google, I bet clothing experts have experimented with various settings/clothing combos.

Cueball: Ooh, someone should make a tool that indexes people's results by washer model, so you can look up what settings to use for a given...
