  I think I see a Mandelbrot set! No, that's just blood spatters. Golly.

[A crime scene is surrounded by tape wound around several pins four of which are inside this panel. A large black pool is on the ground, with splashes around it, and a hammer lying in one of these splashes. Two people are standing outside the tape; a police officer with a peaked cap with a white emblem is standing closest and to his left is a man with male pattern baldness, who we learn is called George.]

Policeman: Looks like a murder-suicide.

George: Any interesting mathematical patterns?

Policeman: No, George, just two dead bodies and a lot of blood.

George: Two... That's the third Fibonacci number!

Policeman: Not now, George.
