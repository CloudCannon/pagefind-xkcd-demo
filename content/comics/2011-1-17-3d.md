[Cueball, another Cueball and Megan are lined up to see a movie.]

Premiering Tonight:

String Theory:

An Expos√©

Presented In 3D!

[Cueball, Cueball 2 and Megan are in a dark theater, fiddling with their 3D glasses.]

*???*

[Cueball, Cueball 2 and Megan angrily approach Black Hat, who's sitting at a desk.]

Megan: Your movie was a ripoff.

Cueball: It wasn't 3D at all!

Black Hat: Was too.

Black Hat: It's just that the third dimension is tightly rolled up and too small to observe at normal energies.
