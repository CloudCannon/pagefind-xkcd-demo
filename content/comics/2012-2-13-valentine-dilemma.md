[Cueball standing with hand on chin.]

Cueball: Flowers seem so... trite. Something homemade? Easy to look halfhearted.

[A frame-less panel of Megan sitting at a computer, also with hand on chin.]

Megan: Valentine's day is a corporate construct.

Megan: But hard to opt out of.

Megan: I don't want to be a corporate tool *or* an inconsiderate jerk.

[Cueball pacing.]

Cueball: How do I fight clich√©? I could get her a gift on a *different* day.

Cueball: But what am I proving?

[Megan leaning back with stapler in hand.]

Megan: It's such a contrived ritual. But maybe rituals are necessary social glue.

[Zoomed in on Cueball panicking.]

Cueball: Forty presents. No, *none!* No, give her five items and then steal two from her.

Cueball: OK, breathe. Keep it together.

[Zoomed in on Megan sweating, still holding the stapler.]

Megan: And what if he gets me something and I don't reciprocate?

Megan: Prisoners dilemma!

Megan: AAAAAAAAAA!!

[Cueball and Megan talking. Cueball is holding a basket and a jar of hammers. Megan's hand is stapled to her face.]

Cueball: I got you Easter candy and a jar of hammers.

Megan: I panicked and stapled my hand to my face.

Cueball: We overthought this.

Megan: Yes.
