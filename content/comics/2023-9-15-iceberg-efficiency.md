title: "Iceberg Efficiency"
num: 2829
alt: >-
  Our experimental aerogel iceberg with helium pockets manages true 100% efficiency, barely touching the water, and it can even lift off of the surface and fly to more efficiently pursue fleeing hubristic liners.

[Black Hat is holding a stick and standing next to a projection screen, or rolled-down printed poster, featuring an image of an iceberg halfway submerged in water, presenting to an unseen audience to the right.]

Black Hat: A standard iceberg is only 10% efficient.

Black Hat: 90% of the ice is hidden underwater, totally wasted.

[Black Hat is now seen face on, standing next to an updated image of the same iceberg with another "iceberg" with all but a small hemispherical lobe almost entirely above the surface of the water now to the right of it.]

Black Hat: Our next-generation foam-filled iceberg achieves near-100% efficiency, floating almost entirely above the ocean surface.

[Black Hat is still holding a stick, facing right, any current image/screen no longer visible to his rear. There are no other people directly shown, but three distinct 'off-frame' voices are indicated from the right.]

Black Hat: "But wait," you might be thinking. "How will such a lightweight iceberg pose a threat to hubristic ocean liners?"

Black Hat: That's where the torpedoes come in.

Off-panel voice 1: I'm sorry, what project are you part of, again?

Off-panel voice 2: I assumed he was with you.

Off-panel voice 3: Security?
