  Some of the KBCU ancillary works try a little too hard to tie everything together. Doris Kearns Goodwin, the sports journalist featured in "Baseball," was somehow ALSO a famous historian who wrote bestselling biographies of Lincoln AND Johnson? Unrealistic.

[Cueball is standing next to Megan.]

Cueball: Lincoln was "President" in *The Civil War* (1990), the same office held by Johnson in *The Vietnam War* (2017).

Cueball: And *Baseball* (1994) briefly showed 1960s "protesters." I think they were protesting Johnson's war!

Cueball: It all fits!

I have a fan theory that every Ken Burns miniseries exists within a single cohesive universe.
