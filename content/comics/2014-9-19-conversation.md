[Cueball and Megan are sitting at a table with drinks.]

Cueball: So, what do you do in your free time?

[Close up on Megan's face.]

Megan: Mostly I sit around worrying someone will ask me that, and try to think of a good answer.

[Back to original shot.]

Cueball: That's not a bad answer.

Megan: It's all I've got. Now that it's done, I should go. Bye!

[She gets up and leaves.]
