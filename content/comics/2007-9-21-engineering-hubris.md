[This comic is illustrated in color. Landscape in the background, canyon with a winding road.]

Maybe engineering is the pursuit of an unattainable perfection.

Maybe it's impossible to create something bug-free.

Maybe the tyranny of Murphy is the penalty for hubris.

But I just can't shake the feeling

[Cueball standing on boxes labeled "ACME."]

With all those supplies
