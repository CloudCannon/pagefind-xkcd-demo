[Ponytail and Cueball are talking.]

Ponytail: Just for the sake of argument, let's say that—

Cueball: —wait, for the sake of what?

[Panel zooms to only show Cueball.]

Ponytail: Argument.

Cueball: Ok, cool, that's *totally* a good reason to say something that's wrong. Gotta have arguments.

[Panel returns to original view.]

Ponytail: I'm just playing Devil's advocate.

Cueball: Ok. So you saw an argument where one side was the <em>Devil</em>, and you were like "Man, *that* guy could use an advocate."

Ponytail: It's...*why* are you being so difficult?

Cueball: For the sake of argument.

Ponytail: ***Argh!***

Cueball: Yay, it's working!
