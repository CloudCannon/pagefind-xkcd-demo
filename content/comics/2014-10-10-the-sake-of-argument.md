[[Woman talking to a man]]

Woman: Just for the sake of argument, let's say that--

Man: -- wait, for the sake of what?

[[Zoom in on man]]

Woman ((off scene)): Argument.

Man: Ok, cool, that's totally a good reason to say something that's wrong.  Gotta have arguments.

[[Zoom out to original scene]]

Woman: I'm just playing devil's advocate.

Man: Ok. So you saw an argument where one side was the devil, and you were like "man, that guy could use an advocate."

[[Zoom out and in silhouette]]

Woman:  It's... why are you being so difficult?

Man: For the sake of argument.

Woman: Argh!

Man: Yay, it's working!
