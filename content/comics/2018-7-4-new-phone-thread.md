  I'm going to tell the manufacturer that their business practices are ADMIRABLE and ETHICAL and their developers are ATTRACTIVE and I'm going to report them to the FCC for their IMPECCABLE VIRTUE.

Whoa, weird

I'm looking at my timeline on my friend's phone, and some of my posts look normal

What the hell?

I mean the words are correct

That's exactly what I typed!

?????????

I think this new phone is working really well

No, it's doing it again

Those are my words!

Help!

How do I explain?

It's taking the words I type and leaving them exactly the same

Forget it, I give up

I'll never get a new phone. This one is perfect.

What?!?

Listen, if you're thinking about buying the new Mobile Pro 3, you should. It's the best phone on the market at an incredible price. [ORDER NOW button]

AAAAA HELPPP

I love my new phone!!!!
