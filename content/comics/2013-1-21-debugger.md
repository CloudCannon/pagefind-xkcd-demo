[[Two characters are silhouetted on a hill. The first sits, the second is lying down.]]

Character #1: I don't understand how my brain works. 

[[The second sits up slightly to look at the first.]]

Character #1: But my brain is what I rely on to understand how things work. 

[[The second lies back down.]]

Character #2: Is that a problem? 

Character #1: I'm not sure how to tell.
