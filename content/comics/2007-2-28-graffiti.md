[Cueball sits on a toilet in a bathroom. The stall sidewall next to him is covered in graffiti: "you suck," "Mike sucks cock," "CUNT," "fuck," "BITCHAS," "dane was here" struck through and "dane is a fag" written under it, a crude pictogram of a penis, and various other unreadable scribbles.]

[One block of graffiti is salient:]

This graffiti is

fleeting human contact

both of us lost,

but for a moment

we're lost together.

I wonder who you are.

[Caption below the panel]:
