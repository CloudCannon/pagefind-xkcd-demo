[Megan and Cueball are walking together while Megan is looking at her smartphone.]

Megan: Did you see there's an emoji movie?

Cueball: If they have to make a movie about a section of Unicode, it's not the ***worst*** choice...

Megan: They should do a whole series. I would watch the *Combining Diacritical Marks movie*.

Cueball: That series would have ***way*** too many characters.
