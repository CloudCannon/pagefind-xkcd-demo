[A drawing of the Chicxulub meteor]

Marking to the right: ≈ 500 km<sup>3</sup> (5 × 10<sup>14</sup> L)

[Five arrows show individual small rocks coming from the meteor and spreading across the Earth. A sixth arrow provides more elaboration.]

Marking of the separate rock: 1 liter rocks

[The rock is shown entering a square marked "1 m<sup>2</sup>", which has another arrow to a larger grid of squares, before an arrow back to the Earth.]

Marking near example square meter: >1 rock per m<sup>2</sup>

[Four dinosaurs are drawn, including a theropod, what may be a velociraptor, a sauropod, and a triceratops. Each has a small rock falling directly toward it.]

Triggered Deccan Traps magma

[The fourth suggestion is circled rather than struck through:]

The rocks hit the dinosaurs
