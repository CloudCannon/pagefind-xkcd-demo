  As best as I can tell, I was transported here from Earth Prime sometime in the late 1990s. Your universe is identical in every way, except for the lobster thing and the thing where some of you occasionally change your clocks for some reason.

Imagine you were transported to an alternate universe just like your own, except people occasionally ate spiders. 

You can't convince anyone this is weird. 

[[Two figures stand. A woman is holding a big spider. The other figure looks shocked. There is another spider on the floor.]]

Woman: Mmm...

Figure: No! What are you *doing*!?

This is how I feel about lobster.
