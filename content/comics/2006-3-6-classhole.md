[[Two men are talking.]]

Man 1: How did you spend your morning?

Man 2: Feeding rocks to children in the park.

Man 1: Your sociopathic abuse of random strangers staggers me.

Man 2: I aspire to have more creativity than the common asshole.

Man 2: I'm more of a classy asshole -- A class-hole, if you will. For example, I like poking tiny holes in styrofoam noodle cups at the grocery store--

Man 2: Thanks to me, someone gets surprise boiling water in the lap.

Man 1: I am in awe.

Man 2: It's even more fun to do to condoms.
