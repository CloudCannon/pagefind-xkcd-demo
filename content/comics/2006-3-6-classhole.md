Cueball: How did you spend your morning?

Black Hat: Feeding rocks to children in the park.

Cueball: Your sociopathic abuse of random strangers staggers me.

Black Hat: I aspire to have more creativity than the common asshole.

Black Hat: I'm more of a <u>classy</u> asshole -- A class-hole, if you will. For example, I like poking tiny holes in styrofoam noodle cups at the grocery store --

Black Hat: Thanks to me, someone gets surprise boiling water in the lap.

Cueball: I am in awe.

Black Hat: It's even more fun to do to condoms.
