Phone: Do you think I could mail a running chainsaw to someone?

Cueball: I doubt it

Phone: What about a baby's first word?

Phone: Can you mail a blank stare?

Phone: A dizzying height?

Phone: Pi?

Cueball: ...

Phone: Well, did you at least get that package of time I sent you?

Cueball: I... you... no, I didn't.

Phone: Well, there was a lot of it, so it will probably take a while
