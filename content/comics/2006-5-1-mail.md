[[A person is talking to someone over the phone.]]

Phone: Do you think I could mail a running chainsaw to someone?

Person: I doubt it.

Phone: What about a baby's first word?

Person: Look, your obsession with sending strange things through the mail is getting out of hand.

Phone: Can you mail a blank stare?

Phone: A dizzying height?

Phone: Pi?

Person: . . .

Phone: Well, did you at least get that package of time I sent you?

Person: I . . . you . . . no, I didn't.

Phone: Well, there was a lot of it, so it will probably take a while.
