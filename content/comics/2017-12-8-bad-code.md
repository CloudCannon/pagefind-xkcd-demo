[Cueball is at his desk on a swivel chair, using his computer. Ponytail walks towards him.]

Ponytail: That's the ugliest mess of code I've ever seen. What on earth are you working on?

[Cueball swivels his chair to face Ponytail in a frameless panel.]

Cueball: It's nothing weird this time, I swear.

Cueball: It just looks bad because it's a spreadsheet formula.

[Cueball is turns back towards the computer while Ponytail looks over his shoulder at the computer screen.]

Cueball: ...which assembles a Haskell function.

Ponytail: Uhhh.

Cueball: ...for parsing HTML.

Ponytail: ...oh my God.

[Ponytail points away from the scene while still looking at the computer screen.]

Cueball: It's ok! Nothing depends on this.

Ponytail: That wall isn't load-bearing. Does that mean we can just throw hammers at it?

Cueball: ...I mean...

Ponytail: Wait. Crap.
