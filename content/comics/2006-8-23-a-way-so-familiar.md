Hairy: I saw a cute girl outside the bank today. She looked nice.

Cueball: Oh no, not again. You are the <u>worst</u> judge of these things.

Hairy: But she was so sweet. Shy, but there was something in her eyes. A pain down in her soul, the same as the one down in mine.

Cueball: Mm hmm.

Hairy: The police light played through her mohawk like the sun setting through pine trees as she shoveled the third hooker into the trunk of the Camry...

Cueball: Back up.
