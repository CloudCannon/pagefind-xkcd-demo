;WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE TITLES

With the right syllable stress pattern to be sung to the tune of the original *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles* theme song

[Six groups of Wikipedia article titles are written out. Each group contains ten titles. The first title of each group is drawn in the style of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles logo, where the final word of each title is drawn in bulbous green text in the shape of an arch, with the remaining words in white text on a red banner above the green text. The remainder of the titles in each group are arranged as a list in standard font next to the larger titles, alternating from right to left hand side going down the comic.]
