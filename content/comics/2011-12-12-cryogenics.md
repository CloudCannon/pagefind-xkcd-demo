  'Welcome to the future! Nothing's changed.' was the slogan of my astonishingly short-lived tech startup.

[[Two people, one of which is staring at a smartphone]]

Person 1: Everyone's carrying sensor-packed, always-connected computers everywhere.  That wasn't true ten years ago.

White Hat Guy: It's all changing too fast, huh?

Person 1: No, too *slowly*.

Person 1: There's so much potential here.  These clumsy, poorly-designed toys are *nothing* compared to what lies ahead.

[[Person 1 climbs into a cryogenic chamber]]

Person 1: That's why I've worked to develop cryogenic freezing.  I'm gonna skip forward 30 years and use this stuff when it's *good*.

30 years later..

Someone who isn't Terry: Welcome to the future! Nothing's changed.

Person 1: What? Why??

[[rows of other people waking up out of their own cryogenic chambers]]

not Terry: When cryogenic freezing was invented, all the engineers who were excited about the future froze themselves. So there's been no one building anything new.

not Terry: But they're all waking up now!

Person 1: Sweet! I'm gonna jump forward to see what they do!

Engineer 1: Me too!

Engineer 2: Wait, uh, guys?
