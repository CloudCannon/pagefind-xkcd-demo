[Cueball sits at a desk with a computer, hands on the keyboard, talking to an unseen observer.]

Cueball: If the corporate surveillance state monitors and controls every aspect of my life...

Big Brother: We do.

Cueball: And I play Dwarf Fortress all day...

Cueball: Then you're effectively Dwarf Fortress players watching your dwarves play Dwarf Fortress.

Big Brother: ... Oh God.
