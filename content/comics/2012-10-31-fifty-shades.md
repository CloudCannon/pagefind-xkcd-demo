  Wishbone and the Illustrated Classics series have gotten me through every conversation I've ever had about Dickens, Treasure Island, The Anarchist's Cookbook, and Our Bodies, Ourselves.

[Cueball is sitting on the floor watching his TV standing on a small table. He is leaning back on one arm resting the other arms hand on his knee. Light is coming out from the TV screen, as shown with nine small lines. A high sound is shown above the TV in a starburst and the sound of a dog barking is coming out from the screen with a line indicating this. Above the drawings there are two paragraphs of text:]

As with most famous books, I've never actually **read** *Fifty Shades of Grey.*

I only know the plot from watching the *Wishbone* version.

Dog in movie: Bark!

Dog in movie: Bark!

Sound: *Smack!*
