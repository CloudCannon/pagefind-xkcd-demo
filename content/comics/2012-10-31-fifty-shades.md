  Wishbone and the Illustrated Classics series have gotten me through every conversation I've ever had about Dickens, Treasure Island, The Anarchist's Cookbook, and Our Bodies, Ourselves.

As with most famous books, I've never actually READ

I only know the plot from watching the 

Wishbone

 version.
