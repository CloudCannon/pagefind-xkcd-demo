[James Bond, drawn as Cueball, is strapped to a giant wheel suspended from the ceiling. Black Hat is standing next to two levers.]

Black hat: How do you like my centrifuge, Mister Bond? When I throw this lever, you will feel centrifugal force crush every bone in your body.

[Same scene, but a closer shot.]

Bond: You mean centripetal force. There's no such thing as centrifugal force.

Black hat: A laughable claim, Mister Bond, perpetuated by overzealous teachers of science. Simply construct Newton's laws in a rotating system and you will see a centrifugal force term appear as plain as day.

[Closer shot, only Bond's head is visible.]

Bond: Come now, do you really expect me to do coordinate substitution in my head while strapped to a centrifuge?

Black hat: No, Mister Bond. I expect you to die.
