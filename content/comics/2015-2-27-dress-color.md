((Identical line drawings of a figure in a dress, but the bits are colored differently.))

((On the left, the figure appears serge blue on a royal blue background, and is wearing a sky blue and walnut brown dress.))

((On the right, the figure appears pale gold on a pale rose background, and is wearing a sky blue and murky green dress.))

((Between them is a series of stripes.))
