  Though please do confirm that it's actually *me* on Klout first, and not one of my friends trying to get me punched. The great thing about this douchebag deadman switch is that I will never dare trigger it.

Person: I'd like to ask a favor.  If someday, in the future, we meet in person, 

Person: And if, as of that day, I've interacted with Klout in *any* way except to opt out, I want you to punch me in the face without warning.

Person: This may sound like a joke, so let me be clear: I am *dead serious*. Ignore anything I say retracting this. Thank you.
