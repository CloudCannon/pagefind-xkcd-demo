[Cueball turns to look behind him; panel pans back to show a (closed) window on the wall.]

[Cueball throws a smoke grenade to the floor.]

*POW*

[Grenade fizzles and begins to emit smoke; Cueball and Megan both look down at it.]

*sssss*

[Smoke cloud expands very slightly. Megan puts her hand to her face.]

*cough*

[The smoke detector alarm above them starts beeping. Both look up.]

[Cueball slowly backs away. The alarm is still beeping.]

-EP BEEP BEEP BEEP B-

[Cueball unsuccessfully tries to open the apparently locked window. The alarm is still beeping.]
