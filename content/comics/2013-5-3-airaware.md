[Cueball and Black Hat looking at a remote-controlled flying object.]

Cueball: What's that?

Black Hat: It's a drone for my new business, *AirAware*.

Black Hat (narrating): Our UAVs follow you and learn your schedule. If you miss a turn, forget an appointment, or give someone inaccurate information, they alert you.

Megan (on phone): I'll be there in five.

Booming voice from the sky: <big>***WRONG!***</big>

Megan: Augh!

Cueball: That sounds annoying. Who would *pay* for that?

Black Hat: Huh? Nobody pays. I'm just making these and releasing them.

Cueball: That's not a business. You're just yelling at strangers from the sky.

Cueball: A business has to make money somehow.

Booming voice from the sky: <big>***WRONG!***</big>

Cueball: Augh!!
