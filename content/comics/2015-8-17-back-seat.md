Title: PROTIP

[[A car is surrounded by two waiting, non-plussed friends while the driver clears the car out.]]

Driver: Hang on, I just have to clear a few things out of the back.

[[The driver opens the door. There are smell lines coming out.]]

Caption: When you hear "I just have to clear a few things out of the back", You are about to see, at minimum, a decaying racoon.
