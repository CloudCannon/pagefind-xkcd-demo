[Megan and Cueball are talking. Megan is looking down and reading a news story on her phone.]

Megan: The CDC says it's okay to mix and match the mRNA vaccines for doses 1 and 2, but only in "exceptional situations".

Cueball: I wonder which order works better, if either.

Megan: Well you know what they say.

Megan: Moderna before Pfizer, you'll be none the wiser.

Cueball: Weird side effect.

Megan: A lot of hard-to-rhyme drugs have those.
