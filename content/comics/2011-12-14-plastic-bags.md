  The high I feel when I actually remember to bring my reusable bags to the store--and take them inside rather than leaving them in the parked car--can last for days.

Fun Fact: Stores have a competition to see who can spread your items across the most plastic shopping bags.

[5 items placed in a single bag; heaviest item placed at the bottom.]

Bag Packer: Here you go!

Shopper: Thanks!

[Same items; heaviest item now placed in separate bag.]

Bag Packer: Here you go!

Shopper: Oh, that's easier to carry.

[Heavy item is now double bagged.]

Bag Packer: Here you go!

Shopper: Double-bagging the big stuff makes sense...

[The other 4 items are now split into 2 separate bags.]

Bag Packer: Here you go!

Shopper: That's a bit wasteful...

[The 2 separate bags are now double bagged.]

Bag Packer: Here you go!

Shopper: You just put five items in six bags.

[Every item is now in its own, double-bagged bag.]

Bag Packer: Here you go!

Shopper: OK! I give up! I'll buy a reusable bag!

[Reusable bag is double-bagged.]

Bag Packer: Here you go!

Shopper: Augh!
