[[Two characters sit at a computer. The hair'd one sits at the controls, and the bald one hovers impatiently behind.]]

Hair'd character: Wait, why can't I click anywhere?

Bald character: I don't... ugh, it opened a dialog box offscreen.

Hair'd character: Why is that even POSSIBLE?

Bald character: It really shouldn't be. But you can fix it by changing your screen resolution to trigger a window cleanup.

Hair'd character: SERIOUSLY?

Bald character: I know, I know...

Caption: To be honest, I can't WAIT for the day when all my stupid computer knowledge becomes obsolete.
