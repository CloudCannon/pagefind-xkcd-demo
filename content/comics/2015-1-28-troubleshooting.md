[Hairy sitting at a desk with laptop, with Cueball standing behind him.]

Hairy: Wait, why can't I click anywhere?

Cueball: I don't... Ugh, It opened a dialog box offscreen.

Hairy: Why is that even *possible?*

Cueball: It really shouldn't be. But you can fix it by changing your screen resolution to trigger a window cleanup.

Hairy: *Seriously?*

Cueball: I know, I know...

To be honest, I can't *wait* for the day when all my stupid computer knowledge becomes obsolete.
