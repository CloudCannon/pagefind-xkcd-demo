[[Pieces of a quote in circles with lines drawn in between them]]

[[Some of the circles are small and colored]]

"Everybody has a secret world inside of them.

All of the people in the whole world

I mean everybody

No matter how dull and boring they are on the outside

Inside they've all got unimaginable

magnificent, wonderful, stupid, amazing, worlds

Not just one world. Hundreds of them. Thousands, maybe."

--Neil Gaiman

Sandman
