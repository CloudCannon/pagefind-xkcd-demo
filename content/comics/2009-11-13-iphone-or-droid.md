[Megan sitting at her computer is talking to Cueball standing behind her.]

Megan: Well, it depends what you want. The iPhone wins on speed and polish, but the Droid has that gorgeous screen and physical keyboard.

Cueball: What if I want something more than the pale facsimile of fulfillment brought by a parade of ever-fancier toys? To spend my life restlessly producing instead of sedately consuming?

Cueball: Is there an app for *that*?

Megan: Yeah, on both.

Megan: Wait, no, looks like it was rejected from the iPhone store.

Cueball: Droid it is, then.
