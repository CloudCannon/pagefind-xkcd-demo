[A man with black hair and a neck beard types away at his computer screen.]

Man (typing): Whatever, noob. I've been on the internet since the BBS days.

Screen (reply from the noob): *Wrong.*

 *type type*

[The noob turns out to be Jill, with two hair buns, who kneels on her chair, typing at a laptop on a table in this frame-less panel.]

Jill (typing): Before I was born, a lab took egg and sperm samples from my parents and sequenced the DNA.

*type type*

[The man sits at his desk, reading his screen.]

Screen (Jill writing): They emailed the genome to the Venter Institute, where they synthesized the genome and implanted it into sperm and eggs which became me.

[Jill still typing on the laptop.]

Jill (typing): So, no.

Jill (typing): You've ***looked*** at the internet.

Jill (typing): I've ***been*** there.
