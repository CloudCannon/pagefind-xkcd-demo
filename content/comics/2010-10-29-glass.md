[Megan is singing, Cueball is staring at a glass of water on a table.]

Megan: EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE... Anything break?

Cueball: No, but the water in the glass turned to wine.

[Cueball picks up glass]

Megan: Weird.

Cueball: No, wait. This is blood.

Megan: Okay, physics, quit fucking with us.
