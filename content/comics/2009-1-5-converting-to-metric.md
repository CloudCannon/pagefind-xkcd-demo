<big>Guide to Converting to Metric</big>

[There are five frames with tables for different units. Between the two upper frames is the following text:]

The key to converting to metric is establishing new reference points. When you hear "26°C", instead of thinking "that's 79°F" you should think, "that's warmer than a house but cool for swimming."

Here are some helpful tables of reference points:

[The frame in the top left lists the following temperatures on the left, with the corresponding descriptions on the right. Next to the last three entries we see Cueball spitting on the ground. The spit freezes.]
