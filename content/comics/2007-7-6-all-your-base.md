[Ponytail is at a computer.]

Ponytail: What's with the All Your Base stuff? Didn't that die like five years ago?

[From off-panel]: Yes.

[Cueball enters the panel.]

Cueball: It was my first internet meme, and my favorite. Others tired of it, but I never did.

Cueball: So I wait.

Cueball: Someday, decades from now, people will have forgotten. It will be fresh again.

Cueball: Retro.

Cueball: And when that day comes,

Cueball: *I WILL BE READY!*

Ponytail: You need a hobby or something.

Cueball: What you say!!

Cueball: Wait, too soon.
