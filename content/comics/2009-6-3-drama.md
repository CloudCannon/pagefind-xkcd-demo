[Megan and two Cueball like guys are sitting together.]

Megan: Man, sex has all these crazy social rules. They just create drama.

Cueball: Let's agree to change them, and make sex simple!

Friend: Okay!

[Cueball gets up and goes out the door.]

Cueball: Hooray! We've solved the problem of drama!

Cueball: I'll go tell everyone!

[There is a graph labeled drama. Below is an axis and below that an arrow marked with time. A vertical dotted line is labeled and indicates the rule change. Drama is low, although fluctuating, before the rule change, then sharply increases afterward and continues to increase.]
