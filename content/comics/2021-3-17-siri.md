[Science Girl is holding her phone up in one hand looking at the screen. A starburst from the phone indicates the voice coming from the phone]

Phone: Your timer is set.

Science Girl: Thanks

[The picture broadens and shows that Science Girl, with the phone now held down, is standing in front of a desk, where Cueball, facing her, is sitting in an office chair using a laptop.]

Science Girl: Is Siri alive?

Cueball: No.

[Back to only showing Science Girl, her phone and arm still held down at her side.]

Science Girl: Oh, ok.

[Same setting but Science Girl has raised her arm with the phone, looking at it again.]

Science Girl: How did she die?
