[Jill is holding her phone up in one hand looking at the screen. A starburst from the phone indicates the voice coming from the phone]

Phone: *Your timer is set.*

Jill: Thanks

[The picture broadens and shows that Jill, with the phone now held down, is standing in front of a desk, where Cueball, facing her, is sitting in an office chair using a laptop.]

Jill: Is Siri *alive?*

Cueball: No.

[Back to only showing Jill, her phone and arm still held down at her side.]

Jill: Oh, ok.

[Same setting but Jill has raised her arm with the phone, looking at it again.]

Jill: How did she die?
