[Beret Guy and Cueball are talking.]

Beret Guy: Remember how I bought my desk chair from that mysterious shop?

Cueball: I think so?

Beret Guy: Turns out the chair was cursed.

[Beret Guy and Cueball are still talking. Beret Guy has his palms out.]

Beret Guy: So I went back to return it, but the shop was gone! The door was boarded up!

Cueball: I think most of the shops are closed because of coronavirus.

[Beret Guy has his hands over his mouth in shock.]

Beret Guy: Oh no!

Beret Guy: *The curse must have caused the pandemic!*

Cueball (off-panel): What.

[Beret Guy starts running with a raised sword in a frameless panel. Cueball is next to him.]

Beret Guy: If I destroy the chair, we can stop the virus!

Cueball: What.

[Beret Guy is chasing a floating desk chair. Cueball is watching. The desk chair speaks with white-on-black text.]

Beret Guy: *Die, plague-bringer!*

Desk chair: <span style="color:white; background:black">Hee hee I can not die</span>

Cueball: Maybe you should just shop at IKEA.
