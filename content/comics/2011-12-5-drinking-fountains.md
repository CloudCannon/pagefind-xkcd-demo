  I've always wondered whether you could drink slowly enough, and eliminate fast enough, that you just sort of peed continuously. But I'm afraid to try because I worry someone might call while I'm doing it and ask what I'm up to, and I won't be able to think of a lie.

[Cueball reenters the bathroom. An arrow points back to the first panel.]

I avoid drinking fountains outside bathrooms because I'm afraid of getting trapped in a loop.
