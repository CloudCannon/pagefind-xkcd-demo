[[squiggly heart design]]

You make me feel so

much it all runs together

I wish I could tell you

[[crisscrossing heart design]]

So few words

for so many feelings

crisscrossing my heart

[[heart matrix design]]

A matrix of desire

Tangled relations

I can't simplify

[[Karnaugh map of hearts]]

I wish I could find

the Karnaugh map

for love.
