[A color drawing of a ferret with airplane wings and tail on it.]

[Cueball and his Cueball-like friend (to the left) are talking.]

Friend: Why on earth did you make those wings? You don't seriously think they could let your ferret fly, right?

Cueball: I... of course not.

[They continue to talk.]

Cueball: That would be pretty dumb. It's just, uh... ...a Halloween costume.

Friend: oh, okay.

[They continue to talk. The head of the ferret can be seen to the far right on a table.]

Friend: Besides, who would want a pet to fly anyway?

Cueball: Yeah. Pretty lame, huh?

[The friend leaves the frame while Cueball stays. The ferret cannot be seen.]

Friend: Anyway, let's go play video games.

[Cueball stands behind after his friend has left. He looks back towards his ferret.]

[Cueball imagines his ferret flying over the ocean near the beach using his makeshift wings while holding his ferret.]
