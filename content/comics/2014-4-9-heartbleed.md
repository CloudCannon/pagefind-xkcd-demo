  I looked at some of the data dumps from vulnerable sites, and it was... bad. I saw emails, passwords, password hints. SSL keys and session cookies. Important servers brimming with visitor IPs. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion, c-beams glittering in the dark near the Tannh√§user Gate. I should probably patch OpenSSL.

Megan: Heartbleed must be the worst web security lapse ever.

Cueball: Worst so far. Give us time.

Megan: I mean, this bug isn't just broken encryption.

Megan: It lets website visitors make a server dispense random memory contents.

Megan: It's not just keys. It's traffic data. Emails. Passwords. Erotic fanfiction.

Cueball: Is ***everything*** compromised?

Megan: Well, the attack is limited to data stored in computer memory.

Cueball: So paper is safe. And clay tablets.

Megan: Our imaginations, too.

Cueball: See, we'll be fine.
