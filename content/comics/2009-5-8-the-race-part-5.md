  It was actually canceled because they just noticed he's been naked under that coat the whole time. There's a petition on Facebook to get Fox to un-cancel it, and one on Livejournal to get him to take off the coat.

[Nathan skates in.]

Nathan: So you took care of him?

Summer: I can extrude hair, but I  can't retract it.

Nathan: That a yes?

[Summer grabs Nathan's arm as he skates past her, pulling him off the board.]

Nathan: Bwah!

[An Andy Capp-esque meleè dust cloud.]

WHAP BAM POW WHAM

[Summer skates away.]

[A beat-up Nathan approaches an similarly battered Cueball.]

Nathan: She may have my board, but I can still beat you to the finish line if I bring you down.

Cueball: Bring it, Captain Tightpants.

Nathan: I've got nothing to  bring. I just said that so she could get behind you.

[Cueball turns.]

Cueball: Who—

[Cueball is hit with his board.]

*WHAM*

[Nathan stands over a prone Cueball.]

Nathan: I just said *that* so *I* could get behind you. The serious fans always fall for the quotes.

[Wide panel of Summer crossing the finishing line on Nathan's board, breaking through the tape.]

Announcer: And the winner is...

Off-screen voice: Summer Glau?

Summer: I swallowed a bug again.

[Close-up of Cueball's beaten face.]

Cueball: All right, Fillion. I've had enough of your treachery and ...rugged good looks. This ends here.

[Equally close-up: Nathan's face, bearing several grazes.]

Nathan: All right, fanboy. Let this be our final battle.

[They rush at each other, fists ready to swing punches.]

Final battle canceled by Fox.
