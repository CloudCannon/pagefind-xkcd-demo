[Cueball at his computer calls out for Megan who comes walking in to the frame.]

Cueball: I, um, messed up my server again.

Megan: I'll take a look. You have the *weirdest* tech problems.

[Zoom in on only Megan who uses the root prompt on the computer.]

<code><font color="gray">~#</font> ls</code>

[Megan stands next to the computer, Cueball sits behind her on his chair. The computer returns the following:]

<code>/usr/share/Adobe/doc/example/android\_vm/root/sbin/ls.jar:</code>

<code>Error: Device is not responding.</code>

[Megan turns towards Cueball who lifts his hands with palm up.]

Megan: What did you *do!?*

Cueball: Maybe the device is busy. Should I try it later?

Megan: You should shut down this system and wait for the Singularity.
