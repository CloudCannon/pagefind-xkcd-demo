[Cueball is standing next to a ball. A flash appears on the left side of the panel.]

[Another Cueball comes in from the left, preparing to kick the ball.]

[The other Cueball kicks the ball into the first Cueball's head.]

[The first Cueball is lying outside of the frame. Second Cueball points and laughs.]

Second Cueball: HAHAHAH

First Cueball: !#^\*!\*

[Second Cueball is now standing next to the ball.]

[To the right, the strip above is looped around like a film strip, but a one-half-turn is put into the loop to make it a MÃ¶bius strip.]
