[Different mathematical equations, all with a heart on left side, and all ending up with question marks.]

√♥ = ?

cos ♥ = ?

d/dx ♥ = ?

<sub>[1 0]♥ = ?</sub>

<sup>[0 1]</sup>

F{♥} = 1/√2π ∫<sup>∞</sup><sub>-∞</sub>f(t)e<sup>it♥</sup>dt = ?

[Caption below the equations:]

My normal approach is useless here.
