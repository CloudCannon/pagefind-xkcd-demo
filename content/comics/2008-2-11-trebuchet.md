[Cueball is working on something on a table, and Megan is sitting at a computer.]

Cueball: The trebuchet is almost done!

Megan: Mm.

Cueball: The range should be over 150 meters.

[Megan leans back on her chair.]

Megan: Look,

Megan: I'm sure it's a cool project.

[Picture of a trebuchet, with some spare parts to its right.]

Megan: But eventually you'll need to outgrow these toys, and focus your energy on something practical.

Megan: This mad science is getting out of hand.

[The camera zooms out, and we see a cross-section of an exterior wall/window from ground to gutter and lower edge of the roof, showing that the characters are inside but the off-frame action is outside.]

Cueball: Says the girl who mounted an auto-targeting kilowatt laser on the roof.

Megan: That's practical! It keeps the squirrels off the feeder!

[From off-frame.]

Laser: *GZZZZZAPP*

Squirrel: *Squeak!*
