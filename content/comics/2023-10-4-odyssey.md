[Ponytail, Cueball and Hairy are standing in a room, each wearing a party hat. Ponytail is to the left of Cueball and Hairy. Cueball is in the middle, holding something, presumably a present.]

Ponytail: Happy birthday!

Cueball: Oh cool, Emily Wilson's *Iliad* translation!

[Cueball is now alone, sitting at a laptop. He has taken his party hat off and put it onto a book on his desk.]

Cueball: I never read her *Odyssey*. I should order that, too.
