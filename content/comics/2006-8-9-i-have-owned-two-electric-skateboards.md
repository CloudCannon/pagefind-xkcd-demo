  Both the skateboards I owned were pretty cheap and broke from heavy use; I'm gonna get a really nice one if I move to the city.

[Caption above the panels:]

How electric skateboards work:

[Cueball is standing on a skateboard, just to the right of a sign. He pushes a button on the remote he has in his hand. The remote is connected to his skateboard through a wire.]

Sign: Point A

*Click*

[Cueball skates while he stands still on the board.]

*Whirrrr*

[He stops just in front of another sign. To his left are three girls; Megan, Ponytail, and another Megan-like girl with even longer hair than the first. Below them are three arrows pointing to each of them and a label connected to all three arrow.]

Sign: Point B

Label: Chicks
