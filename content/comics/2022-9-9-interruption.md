  It's been extra bad ever since my GPS got stuck on Phoebe Judge mode.

[Cueball and Ponytail are facing each other from opposite sides of a table. They are sitting in office chairs and are both wearing headsets. They are speaking into microphones standing on the table in front of them.]

Cueball: ...And that's when you knew she had betrayed you?

Ponytail: Yeah.

Ponytail: She picked up the money and walked out.

[Close-up of Ponytail with the headset on seen from the waist up.]

Ponytail: To this day, I don't know if she planned it all.

Ponytail: But there was one moment that makes me think, maybe she did.

[A frame-less section for Ponytail's voice-over is placed above the next panel. The panel, which is thus half the normal height, is mainly black with a white door opening from which white light is shining on to the floor. A silhouette of a Megan-like woman stands in the doorway, holding a bag in one hand. Ponytail tells what she said and that part is written in white on the black part above the woman.]

Ponytail (voice-over): Just before she disappeared, she paused at the door, looked back at me, and said,

Ponytail (voice-over for the woman): Hey - if I ever see you again,

[Close-up of the woman with the bag in silhouette in the white doorway. (Note that from the context of the caption it becomes clear that this was actually said by the GPS navigation system, but at this point of reading, it is taken as Ponytail's voice-over.)]

Ponytail (voice-over for the woman): Turn left at the next light.

[Caption below the panels:]

It's so disorienting when a podcaster has a voice that's similar to my navigation app.
