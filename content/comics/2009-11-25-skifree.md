[A screenshot of SkiFree, with the abominable snowman running towards the player.]

[Megan is sitting at her computer with her hands on the keyboard and thinking to herself:]

Megan (thought bubble): I've always thought of the SkiFree monster as a metaphor for the inevitability of death.

[Cueball comes up behind her in a frameless panel.]

Cueball: SkiFree, huh? You know, you can press "F" to go faster than the monster and escape.

[The screenshot again. The player is zooming away from the monster.]

[Megan sits at her computer in silence, with her hands now down to her side.]
