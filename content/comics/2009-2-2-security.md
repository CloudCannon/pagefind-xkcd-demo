[Cueball is holding a laptop up in two hands, showing it to his Cueball-like friend who is examining it while holding a hand up to his head. Above the top of the panels frame, there is a box with a caption:]

A Crypto nerd's imagination:

Cueball: His laptop's encrypted. Let's build a million-dollar cluster to crack it.

Friend: No good! It's 4096-bit RSA!

Cueball: Blast! Our evil plan is foiled!

[Cueball is holding a closed laptop down in one hand while giving his Cueball-like friend a wrench with the other. The friend reaches out for it. Above the top of the panels frame, there is a box with a caption:]

What would actually happen:

Cueball: His laptop's encrypted. Drug him and hit him with this $5 wrench until he tells us the password.

Friend : Got it.
