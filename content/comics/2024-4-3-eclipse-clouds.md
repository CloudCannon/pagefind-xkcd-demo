[Cueball sits on an office chair at a desk, typing at his laptop.]

Cueball: These eclipse weather forecasts are killing me.

Laptop: *refresh*

[Cueball remains at his desk. An off-panel voice from the left speaks.]

Off-panel voice: So you really want to see something block out the sun...

[Cueball is still at his desk.]

Off-panel voice: ...But not a cloud. It has to be the Moon specifically.

Cueball: ***My tastes are very singular!***
