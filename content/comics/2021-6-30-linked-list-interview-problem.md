  I'd traverse it myself, but it's singly linked, so I'm worried that I won't be able to find my way back to 2021.

[Cueball is writing on a whiteboard with a blue pen with Ponytail looking over his shoulder. The text on the board is unreadable, but it is is written in blue above them. It is a piece of code and it reads:]

    <font color="blue">define traverseLinkedList(headPointer):

       myId="*<illegible scribbling>*"

       authToken="*<illegible>*"

       museumAddress="*<illegible>*@*<illegible>*.*<illegible>*"

       client=mailRestClient(myID, authToken)

       client.messages.send(to=museumAddress,

       subj="Item donation?", body="Thought you

       might be interested: "+str(headPointer))

       return</font>

Ponytail: *Hey.*

Coding interview tip: Interviewers get really mad when you try to donate their linked lists to a technology museum.
