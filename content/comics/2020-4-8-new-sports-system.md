[Single wide frame representing a basketball court with a basketball hoop at each end.  There are seven players running around the court, with a virtual ball in the bottom right corner (indicated as a dashed circle).  Nine off-screen voices of "online viewers" are yelling instructions to the players.  A caption is below the frame running nearly the full width of the frame.]

Viewer One: No!

Viewer Two: It's on the&ndash;

Viewer Three: Look out!

[A player with thick hair and a goatee is "air-shooting" into the left-hand basket.]

Viewer Four: *No!*

[A player with thick hair is running to the right.]

Viewer Five: He's right there

Viewer Five: Donâ€™t run into&ndash;

[A player with no hair is air-dribbling to the right.]

Viewer Six: Go *left!*

Viewer Seven: *Left!*

Viewer Eight: *Riiight!*

[A player with thick hair and a full beard is facing left and jumping, hands raised to intercept a ball.]

[A player with no hair is facing left and crouching, reaching for a ball.]

[A player with no hair is making an alley-oop motion towards the right-hand basket.]

Viewer Nine: *Stop dunking and find the ball!*

[The virtual ball is slowly moving right, unseen by the players.]

[A player is hanging on the rim of the basket, making a dunking motion.]

Caption below the panel: No one liked my new sports system, in which each player is in a separate arena sharing a single virtual ball that they can't see while online viewers yell instructions, but it was fun to watch while it lasted.
