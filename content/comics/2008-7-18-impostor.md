[Caption above the panels:]

My Hobby:

Sitting down with grad students and timing how long it takes them to figure out that I'm not actually an expert in their field.

[For all four panels below, there are two frames crossing the border of each panel. The ones at the top left have a caption, and the one below right has the result of the timing.]

[Ponytail and Cueball are sitting across from each other in office chairs.]

Engineering:

Ponytail: Our big problem is heat dissipation

Cueball: Have you tried logarithms?

48 seconds

[Cueball is sitting in a chair at the center of a table looking left at another Cueball-like guy. To the right is a long black-haired girl.]

Linguistics:

Cueball: Ah, so does this Finno-Ugric family include, say, Klingon?

63 seconds

[Cueball is standing with his hands up talking to another Cueball-like guy and Megan who has lifted her arm to palm her face.]

Sociology:

Cueball: Yeah, my latest work is on ranking people from best to worst.

4 minutes

[Cueball is sitting in an armchair with another Cueball-like guy sitting attentively in front of him on the floor.]

Cueball: You see, the deconstruction is inextricable from not only the text, but also the self.
