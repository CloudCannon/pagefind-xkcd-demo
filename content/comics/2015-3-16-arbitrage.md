[Cueball and Hairy are sitting at a table with a bowl of chips in the middle. Hairy is taking chips from the bowl on the table with one hand, and his other hand is dropping chips into a large bag behind him. Cueball is double facepalming.]

Hairy: *They're* the ones giving chips away!

Hairy: If they don't see the arbitrage potential, sucks for them.

[On the bag is written: Chips.]
