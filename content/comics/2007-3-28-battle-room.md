[A scene is depicted from the Battle Room of the novel Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card. The boys are floating in a room with random cubes.]

Dink: Sorry, Ender â€” seems like there were some system crashes. The battle's gotta be cut short.

Ender: The lasers still work.

Dink: Yeah, but the enemy's gate is down.
