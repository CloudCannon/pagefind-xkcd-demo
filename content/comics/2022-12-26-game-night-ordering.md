  One good trick, if you get called on a fake service, is to build a working version of it and mention it again the next week.

[Cueball, Megan, and Ponytail are sitting at a table to order food. Cueball is on his phone, and Ponytail, sitting opposite, is on her laptop.]

Cueball: What should we use to order? Grubhub? DoorDash? Food.net?

Ponytail: I'll do Grubhub; you can send me money. Do you do Venmo? Paypal? Yahoo Cash?

Cueball: Yahoo Cash *has* to be fake.

Ponytail: Yes. Dang. I'll get your share.

[Caption below the panel:]

Our game night has an ongoing competition to see who can mention the most fake apps and services without getting called on it.
