[[Three people stand facing what we can assume are the Doors of Durin (not pictured). One has a hat, one has hair, the other has neither.]]

Hair: I've got it! What's the Elvish word for friend?

Neither: 

Mellon.

[[The three watch as the doors begin to open.]]

<<RUMBLE>>

[[The one in the white hat poses a question.]]

Hat: So what's the Elvish word for "frenemy"? 

Neither: ...

mellogoth?

<<SLAM!!>>
