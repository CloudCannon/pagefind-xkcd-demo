  For sentimental reasons, every active Mars rover is counted as one person, although that's not enough to make Mars more than a dot.

[Above a chart are two paragraphs with explanation:]

Most solar system diagrams are misleading.

This chart offers a more accurate view by showing the planets sized by population.

[Below the explanation is a list of the eight planets in the solar system. They are shown in order with labels. All but Earth show up only as dots. Earth is large and clearly drawn, with a view approximately centered on Indonesia. The spacing between the dots is equal, and the same distance as from those closest dots to Earth to Earths surface. Earth's label floats below it, while the other planets' labels connect to their respective dots with lines, with text either above or below the line of planets:]

Mercury

Venus

Earth

Mars

Jupiter

Saturn

Uranus

Neptune
