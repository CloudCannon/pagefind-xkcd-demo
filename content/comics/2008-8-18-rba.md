[Megan walks up to Cueball pouring himself a drink.]

Megan: Now, this is a story all about how

Megan: My life got flipped turned upside down

Megan: And I'd like to take a minute

Megan: Just sit right there

Megan: I'll tell you how I became uncertain about our relationship. I think you just like having a girlfriend, it doesn't matter who.

Megan: I think we should break up.

The reverse Bel-Air only works once, so make it something unforgettable.

[Cut to a dropped glass, the drink spilled on the ground.]

Cueball: ...wait, seriously?

Megan: Yeah.
