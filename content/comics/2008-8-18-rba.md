[[Girl walks up to boy pouring himself a drink]]

Girl: Now, this is a story all about how

Girl: My life got flipped turned upside down

Girl: And I'd like to take a minute

Girl: Just sit right there

Girl: I'll tell you how I became uncertain about our relationship. I think you just like having a girlfriend, it doesn't matter who.

Girl: I think we should break up.

[[Cut to dropped glass, drink spilled on ground]]

Narrator: The reverse Bel-Air only works once, so make it something unforgettable.

Boy: ...wait, seriously?

Girl: Yeah.
