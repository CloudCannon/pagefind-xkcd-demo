  FYI, it turns out "...because I haven't figured out whether he would be my brother-in-law or not" does NOT qualify as a "reason why these two should not be wed."

[A single layer of a family tree with 15 people depicted as sticky figures side by side is shown. They are connected alternated either by a bracket on top or a short line between them. The four outermost figures on each side are faded out in gray.]

[In the middle is Cueball and from below an arrow points at him:]

Me

[To the left Ponytail is connected by a bracket and the arrow below says:]

Sibling

[To the right of Cueball Megan is shown connected by a small line, an arrow below her reads:]

Spouse

[Further to the left and the right the next figures have an arrow below with the nested text:]

Siblings-in-law

[The next connected figures on both sides are drawn with two other wider arrows embedding this statement:]

Also siblings-in-law, I think?

[All remaining figures left and right have similar arrows below and the text is:]

Possible *additional* siblings-in-law???

[Caption below the frame:]

People complain that “<X><sup>th</sup> cousin <Y> times removed” is hard to understand, but to me the most confusing one is sibling-in-law, because it chains across both sibling and marriage links and I don't really know where it stops.
