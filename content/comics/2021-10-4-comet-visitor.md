[Megan sits at a desk in front of a computer, looking to the left off-panel and pointing at the screen]

Megan: Have you seen this big comet, C/2014 UN271?

Megan: It'll pass near Saturn's orbit in 10 years.

[In a frameless panel, Cueball stands behind Megan, who is now looking at the computer and typing]

Cueball: Wow, look at the orbital period.

Megan: Yeah, it hasn't been to this part of the solar system since humans evolved.

Megan: At ***least.***

[Cueball starts running off-panel, holding his finger in the air. Megan looks towards him with both arms resting on the back of her chair]

Cueball: Well, we definitely need to tidy up. I'll start on the Pacific Garbage Patch, you tackle orbital debris.

Megan: What about the moon footprints?

Cueball: Sweep them up. Collect the Mars rovers, too!

Cueball: We can put them back once it's gone.
