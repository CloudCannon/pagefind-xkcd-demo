  "But there are seven billion people in the world! I can't possibly stop to consider how ALL of them might interpret something!" "Ah, yes, there's no middle ground between 'taking personal responsibility for the thoughts and feelings of every single person on Earth' and 'covering your eyes and ears and yelling logically correct statements into the void.' That's a very insightful point and not at all inane."

[Cueball is sitting in an office chair at a desk in front of a laptop with his hands raised above the keyboard. An off-panel person replies to his remarks.]

Cueball: Ugh, people are mad at me again because they don't read carefully.

Cueball: I'm being perfectly clear. It's not ***my*** fault if everyone misinterprets what I say.

Off-panel person: Wow, sounds like you're great at communicating, an activity that famously involves just one person.
