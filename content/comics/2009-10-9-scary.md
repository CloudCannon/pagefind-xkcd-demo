  I'm teaching every 8-year-old relative to say this, and every 14-year-old to do the same thing with Toy Story. Also, Pokemon hit the US over a decade ago and kids born after Aladdin came out will turn 18 next year.

[Rob and his nephew (also drawn like a Cueball, but smaller) are sitting on the ground facing each other. Rob is holding a flash-light up to his face and leans back on the other arm, while crossing his legs. The nephew is sitting forward resting one arm on his lifted knees and leaning back on his other arm.]

Rob: But they *never found the ghost's head!*

Nephew: Lame story, Uncle Rob.

Rob: And you could do scarier?

Nephew: Sure.

[Rob has removed the flash-light from his face and the nephew leans more back and has shifted a leg down so only one knee supports the arm which are now more straight.]

Rob: Try me.

Nephew: 9/11 happened before I was born, yet I'm old enough to have this conversation with you.

[Rob has dropped the flash-light. The nephew has taken the other arm down to the ground. Beat panel.]

[Rob has curled his legs up to his chin and wrapped his arms around them while the nephew relaxes even more.]
