[[Two men stand talking to each other]]

First Man: If we lose this election, I'm moving to Canada.

Second Man: You say that every year.

First Man: I mean it this time.

Second Man: Well, becoming a citizen takes work.  Meanwhile, you have no money, half an art degree, and it's the start of winter.  You'll freeze to death in the streets.

First Man: Whatever.

[[Second man raises his hands]]

Second Man: No, don't you get it?  If you die in Canada, you die in REAL LIFE!
