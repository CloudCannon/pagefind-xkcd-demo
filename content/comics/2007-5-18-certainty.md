[A door seen from a hallway, with "Teachers' Lounge" on the glass. Next to the door, a framed "Award" certificate is displayed. Silhouetted through the glass, two teachers can be seen talking.]

Megan: My students drew me into another political argument.

Cueball: Eh; it happens.

Megan: Lately, political debates bother me. They just show how good smart people are at rationalizing.

[Internal view of the room. The two teachers, Megan and Cueball, continue talking. Megan has her arms raised. Miss Lenhart is seen reading a book on a sofa.]

Megan: The world is so complicated - the more I learn, the less clear anything gets. There are too many ideas and arguments to pick and choose from. How can I trust myself to know the truth about anything?

Megan: And if everything I know is so shaky, what on Earth am I doing teaching?

[Megan and Cueball continue talking. Cueball has his hand raised. Miss Lenhart has looked up from her book.]

Cueball: I guess you just do your best. No one can impart perfect universal truths to their students.

Miss Lenhart: \*ahem\*

Cueball: ...Except math teachers.

Miss Lenhart: Thank you.
