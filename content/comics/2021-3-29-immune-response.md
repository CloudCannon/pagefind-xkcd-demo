[Megan is walking toward Cueball, who is holding his arm.]

Megan: How you feeling?

Cueball: Not bad. Tired. A little sore.

[Zoom in on Cueball. He looks down at his arms, which are held out.]

Cueball: I feel bad for my immune system. It doesn't know this isn't a real virus. It must be freaking out.

Cueball: Hey buddy, don't worry! We're going to be fine. This is just practice!

[Zoom out. Megan gestures at Cueball, as he holds his arm.]

Megan: No, don't tell it *that*. You ***want*** it to panic and build defenses that will be able to handle the real thing.

Cueball: I guess.

Cueball: Okay, let me try that again.

Cueball: \*ahem\*

[Cueball dramatically clutches at his chest.]

Cueball: Woe! My arm is stricken by a dreadful plague!

Cueball: I feel death draw near! My only hope is those heroic immune cells!

Megan: Perfect.

Cueball: <small>*Psst - you're doing great! I'm so proud of you.*</small>
