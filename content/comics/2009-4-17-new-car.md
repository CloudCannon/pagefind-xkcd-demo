[A Cueball-like guy is standing behind, a sports car where Cueball sits turned toward him.]

Friend: When'd you get the car?

[Zoom-in on Cueball in the car.]

Cueball: It's the darndest thing. We bought it as a prize for the 100,000,000<sup>th</sup> visitor to our website.

[Zoom-in on the friend.]

Friend: And they didn't want it?

Cueball (off-screen): Apparently.

[Pan to where both the friend and Cueball in the car can be seen, but not the front of the car.]

Friend: Maybe they didn't see the notice.

Cueball: It was flashing and everything!

Friend: How bizarre.
