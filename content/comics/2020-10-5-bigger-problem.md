[Cueball, holding a clipboard next to his body in his left hand, holds his right hand palm up towards White Hat.]

Cueball: I'm trying to fix <problem with the world>. Can you help?

[Cueball stands with both arms down while white Hat lift one hand up toward Cueball.]

White Hat: It's obvious you don't actually care. If you did, you'd be trying to fix <bigger problem> instead.

[Same setting as the first picture, wit Cueball's hand a bit further out towards White Hat.]

Cueball: Okay, want to help fix <bigger problem>?

White Hat: No, for another reason I'll think of later.
