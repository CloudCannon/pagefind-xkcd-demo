  I admit this is an exaggeration, since I can think of at least three parties I attended while doing my degree, and I'm probably forgetting several more.

[Cueball and Megan are talking to each other.]

Cueball: Apparently some university reopened based on a COVID model developed by two physicists.

Megan: Uh oh.

[Cueball raises an arm slightly.]

Cueball: But even their worst-case model underestimated the number of student parties and they had to shut down.

[Cueball holds up a finger.]

Megan: Can't understand why someone with a physics degree would be bad at judging how often college students get invited to parties.

Cueball: Excuse me, I was invited to multiple parties.

Cueball: And attended both of them!
