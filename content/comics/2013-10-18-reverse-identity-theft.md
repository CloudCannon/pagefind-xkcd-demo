  I asked a few friends whether they'd had this happen, then looked up the popularity of their initials/names over time. Based on those numbers, it looks like there must be at least 750,000 people in the US alone who think 'Sure, that's probably my email address' on a regular basis.

If your email address is <font color=#888>[First initial]+[Last name]@gmail.com</font> you gradually get to know lots of older people who have the same name pattern

Cueball: Yes, I know it would make ***sense*** if that were your email address, but it's not.

Person on the phone: But how did you get my number?

Cueball: Your phone bill.
