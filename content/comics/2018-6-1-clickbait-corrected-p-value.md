[Under a heading that says Clickbait-Corrected p-Value there is a mathematical formula. Below that is the description of the two used variables and what they mean:]

Clickbait-corrected p-value:

PCL = Ptraditional âˆ™ click(H1)/click(H0)

H0: NULL hypothesis ("Chocolate has no effect on athletic performance")

H1: Alternative hypothesis ("Chocolate boosts athletic performance")

click(H): Fraction of test subjects who click on a headline announcing that H is true
