[Under a heading that says Clickbait-Corrected p-Value there is a mathematical formula. Below that is the description of the two used variables and what they mean:]

Clickbait-corrected p-value:

P<sub>CL</sub> = P<sub>traditional</sub> âˆ™ click(H<sub>1</sub>)/click(H<sub>0</sub>)

H<sub>0</sub>: NULL hypothesis ("Chocolate has no effect on athletic performance")

H<sub>1</sub>: Alternative hypothesis ("Chocolate boosts athletic performance")

click(H): Fraction of test subjects who click on a headline announcing that H is true
