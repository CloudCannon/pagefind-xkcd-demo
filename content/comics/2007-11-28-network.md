[Megan looking at a large screen with many green and red squares. The squares have writing in them and lines connecting them.]

[Side view. The screen is a huge LCD connected to a wireless router.]

Cueball: Pretty, isn't it?

Megan: What is it?

Cueball: I've got a bunch of virtual Windows machines networked together, hooked up to an incoming pipe from the net. They execute email attachments, share files, and have no security patches.

Cueball: Between them they have practically every virus.

Cueball: There are mail trojans, warhol worms, and all sorts of exotic polymorphics. A monitoring system adds and wipes machines at random. The display shows the viruses as they move through the network. Growing and struggling.

[Cueball walks past the girl and touches the monitor.]

Megan: You know, normal people just have aquariums.

Cueball: Good morning, Blaster. Are you and W32.Welchia getting along?

Cueball: <u>Who's</u> a good virus? You are! Yes, you are!
