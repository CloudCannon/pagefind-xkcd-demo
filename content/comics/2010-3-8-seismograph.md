[Cueball is standing over another man, who is strapped into a chair with wires attached to his head and arms. The wires lead to a large lie detector on a stand next to him, which has jagged lines drawn across it.]

Cueball: *IS THERE AN EARTHQUAKE HAPPENING?!*

Sitting man: No!

Lie detector: *scritch scritch*

[Caption below the panel:]

Pro tip: In a pinch, a lie detector can double as a seismograph.
