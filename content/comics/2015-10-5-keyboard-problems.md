[Cueball sits between two laptops. Megan stands behind him.]

Cueball: Keys on my keyboard keep failing, even when I boot from an external recovery disk.

Megan: Sounds like it's hardware, then.

[Cueball moves over to the laptop behind him.]

Cueball: Yeah... except the problem followed me from my *last* computer.

Megan: You have the most *bizarre* tech issues.

[Cueball picks up the keyboard from the rear computer and plugs it into the one in front of him.]

Cueball: It must be spreading via keyboards. This one won't work with *any* computer now.

Megan: When the robot apocalypse happens, I'm hiding out in your house. Any Skynet drones that come near will develop inexplicable firmware problems and crash.
