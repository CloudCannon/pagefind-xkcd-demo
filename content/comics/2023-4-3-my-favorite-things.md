[Cueball is standing between a small rosebush and a kitten.]

Cueball (singing): Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens

[Cueball is now wearing mittens and holding a kettle with flakes falling off it. The kitten is looking up at him. There is another kettle on the ground next to the rosebush.]

Cueball (singing): Bright copper kettles leave ...flakes on my mittens!?

[Cueball has turned the kettle he's holding upside down and is examining it. More flakes are falling off of it, seemingly drawing the kitten's interest.]

Cueball (singing): Hey, these are stone with a copper veneer!

[Cueball is holding his hands out with his elbows bent, still wearing the mittens, and perhaps with fists raised slightly in shock or anger, or perhaps just the exuberance of song. The two kettles are next to each other on the ground by the rosebush. The kitten is looking up at him again.]

Cueball (singing): I've been bamboozled by Ea-nāṣir!
