[Megan and Cueball sitting against a leafless tree; they are on opposite sides.]

Megan: Mark Zuckerberg is testifying before Congress this week.

Cueball: Should be interesting.

[Beat panel.]

Megan: I recently re-watched Terminator.

Cueball: Yeah?

Megan: It's weird that the thing that evolved into Skynet wasn't our nuclear launch systems or our humanoid robots.

Megan: It was the phone book where the Terminator looked up Sarah Connor's address.

Cueball: Funny how things turn out.
