[[Man in a hallway looking in on a board meeting.]]

I'd tap that ass

To be the new committee chair.

[[Man wearing headphones with a briefcase and a laptop.  Another man on a telephone.]]

I'd tap that ass

Without a warrant.

[[Man with his hand on his chin, looking at a tree.]]

I'd tap that ass

And extract delicious maple syrup.

[[Man standing in a blank frame.]]

I'd have sex

With that tree.
