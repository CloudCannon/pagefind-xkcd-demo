[Cueball and Megan walking together while talking.]

Megan: It's pretty weird that we've had two totally unrelated presidents whose last names start with ***"T-R-U-M-"***.

Cueball: Oh, sure, that's *definitely* the weirdest thing about the presidency right now.

Megan: It's less weird than ***every other fact***. But still weird.

Cueball: True.
