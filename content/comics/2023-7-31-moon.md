[Ponytail is pointing and looking up to the left, while Cueball behind her looks the same way.]

Ponytail: That thing hanging in the sky is a second nearby world. It's close enough that you can see its surface as it passes overhead.

Cueball: Wow. Isn't that ... weird?

Ponytail: I dunno, it's just always been there.
