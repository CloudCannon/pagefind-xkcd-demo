[Cueball and Megan talking.]

Megan: So are you worried about the rapture?

Cueball: No, unless it figures out how to open doors.

Megan: I said *rapture.*

Cueball: Oh, I'm not really into that. I'm the kind of Christian who only goes to church on Christmas and Easter, and then spends the other 363 days at the mosque.

Megan: ...I don't think that's a thing.

Cueball: <small>Our rabbi swears it's legit.</small>

Cueball: What religion are you?

Megan: Experimentalist Monotheism.

Cueball: Which is?

Megan: We believe there's one god, but we're trying to find the error bars on that number.
