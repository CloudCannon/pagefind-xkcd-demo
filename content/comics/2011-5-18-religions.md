Woman: So are you worried about the rapture?

Man: No, unless it figures out how to open doors.

Woman: I said RAPTURE.

Man: Oh. I'm not really into that. I'm the kind of Christian who only goes to church on Christmas and Easter, and then spends the other 363 days at the Mosque.

Woman: ... I don't think that's a thing.

Man: Our rabbi swears it's legit.

Man: What religion are you?

Woman: Experimentalist monotheism.

Man: Which is?

Woman: We believe there's one god, but we're trying to find the error bars on that number.
