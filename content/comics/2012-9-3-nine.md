  FYI: If you get curious and start trying to calculate the time adjustment function that minimizes the gap between the most-used and least-used digit (for a representative sample of common cook times) without altering any time by more than 10%, and someone asks you what you are doing, it is easier to just lie.

[Cueball stands at a microwave, which hangs on the wall above the stove.]

Cueball: How long do you zap these?

Character off-frame: Two minutes.

Cueball: Thanks!

[Buttons being pushed.]

<small>\*Beep\*</small> 1

<small>\*Beep\*</small> 5

<small>\*Beep\*</small> 9

Cueball:*<small> It's ok, nine.</small>*

Cueball:*<small> You are not forgotten.</small>*

[Caption below the frame:]

Ever since I heard the simile "As neglected as the nine button on the microwave." I've found myself adjusting cook times.
