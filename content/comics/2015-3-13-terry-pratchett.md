[Cueball is reading a book over the first four panels at the top of the comic. He shifts position from sitting, leaning back on one hand, laying down on his belly to finally sitting more upright. Above these four panels and breaking the frame of the outer panels of the comic we see what he reads during these four panels:]

*I told her we were going to get married, and all she could talk about was frogs.*

*She said there's these hills where it's hot and rains all the time, and in the rainforests there are these very tall trees and right in the top branches

*of the trees there are these like great big flowers called... bromeliads, I think, and water gets into the flowers and makes little pools and there's a

*type of frog that lays eggs in the pools and tadpoles hatch, and grow into new frogs and these little frogs live their whole lives in the flowers right

*at the top of the trees and don't even know about the ground, and once you know the world is full of things like that, your life is never the same.*

*â€” Masklin, Terry Pratchett's* ***The Bromeliad Trilogy***

[Below are four more panels. Cueball stops reading in the book. Leaves the book and begins to walk. Walks out on a leaf from a big flower. Finally, zooming in on him at the edge of the leaf, he looks down and sees what is below the flower.]
