[A depiction primarily of the Atlantic Ocean and the surrounding landmasses. The land is black, leaving the oceans and seas white except for the following words written in sixteen lines of text (from just below the tip of Greenland/Arctic Ocean down to slightly above the Falkland Islands/Southern Ocean) that are, for the most part, wrapped between the Atlantic coastline 'margins' (as defined by the Americas on the left and Europe/Africa on the right, or significant island groups:]

If you

covered

the surface of

the Atlantic Ocean

with twelve-point

printed text,

with the lines

wrapping at

the coasts, the

expansion of

the ocean basin

due to plate

tectonics would

increase your word

count by about 100

words per second.
