  I'm always installing tons of weird experimental keyboards because it serves as a good reminder that nothing I was going to type was really worth the trouble.

[[A figure walks on screen, holding a phone, and starts talking to black hat guy.]]

Figure: Did you get my texts? 

Black hat guy: You should install this keyboard I found. 

Figure: What? Why? Is it better than SwiftKey?

Black hat guy: In some ways. 

[[Black hat guy begins to walk off-panel.]]

Figure: Ok, installing... It's not working. The key area is blank-I can't type anything. 

[[Black hat guy has left. The figure stares at their phone.]]

[[The figure lets their hand fall to their side.]]

Figure: ... Hey.
