[Cueball walks on screen, holding a phone, and starts talking to Black Hat.]

Cueball: Did you get my texts?

Black Hat: You should install this keyboard I found.

Cueball: What? Why? Is it better than SwiftKey?

Black Hat: In some ways.

[Black Hat begins to walk off-panel.]

Cueball: Ok, installing...

Cueball: It's not working. The key area is blankâ€”I can't type anything.

[Black Hat has left. Cueball stares at his phone.]

[Beat frame. Cueball lets his hands fall to their side.]

Cueball: ...Hey.
