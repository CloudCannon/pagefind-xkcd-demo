  On Mondays I go running, so you'll have to get up early and follow along a parallel street. What fun!

[Cueball and Ponytail stand facing one another. Both hold sheets of paper. Cueball holds a restraining order, while Ponytail holds a map with two concentric circles drawn on it.]

Not content with <u>normal</u> restraining orders, my ex got creative.

Cueball: Wait... I can't get closer than 500 yards of you... <u>or</u> more than 600 yards away?

Ponytail: You'll have to move somewhere within this ring.
