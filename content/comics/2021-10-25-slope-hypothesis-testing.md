[Three points are labeled "Student A", "Student B" and "Student C" from left to right in a scatter plot with axes labeled "Stats exam grade" (60-100) and "Scream loudness (decibels)" (86-94) with a trend line. Student B has the highest exam grade, followed by Student C and then Student A.]

[A line goes from the trend line to a box containing the following:]

β=1.94

p=0.586

[In a frameless panel, Megan reads a piece of paper while facing Cueball while three students look at them from the background.]

Megan: Darn, not significant.

Cueball: We need more data. Have them each try yelling into the mic a few more times.

[The same scatter plot as in the first panel except with more points for each of the students with slightly different decibel values, and the text in the text box changed to:]

β=1.94

p=0.037\*

\*Significant!

[Similar panel to the second one]

Megan: Perfect!

Cueball: Are you *sure* we're doing slope hypothesis testing right?
