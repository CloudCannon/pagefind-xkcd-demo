  Bald-faced hornets are only a 2 on the Schmidt pain index, so I shouldn't complain. The tennis ball ejected from the dryer exhaust vent could have ricocheted off the nest of a much higher-scoring insect before knocking me off the ladder. Really, I'm lucky.

[Cueball and Megan are standing together. Cueball has his hands on his chin, shocked.]

Cueball: I can't believe you fell headfirst into a garbage can and were stuck there for two hours while wasps stung your exposed legs!

Megan: I shouldn't complain! Lots of people have been stuck for longer in worse places.

Megan: Really, I'm lucky.

The more unpleasant someone's experience is, the more they apologize for complaining because it could be worse.
