[[Two people are having a conversation.]]

Person 1: 9

11 was an inside job! Jet fuel can't burn hot enough to melt steel!

Person 2: Well, remember - jet fuel wasn't the only thing on those planes. They would've also carried tanks full of the mind-control agents airliners use to make chemtrails. Who 

knows

Person 1: Whoa. Good point!
