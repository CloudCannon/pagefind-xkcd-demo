[Cueball and Megan are looking down at a baby, throwing its arms in the air, standing between them.]

Cueball: Oh man, we made a baby.

Megan: *Don't panic. Don't panic.*

Baby: Baby!

[Cueball looks at Megan, who still look down at the baby, which now looks down at her feet.]

Cueball: Parenting can't be that hard. Let's just do what comes naturally.

[In a frame-less panel they all three just stand there, they look down and the baby has spread it's arms out. Beat frame.]

[A caption is in a frame at the top of the panel. Cueball and Megan are looking down between them. There are now two babies, one larger looking at Cueball's feet the smaller looking at Megan's feet.]

Soon:

Megan: Aw, crap.
