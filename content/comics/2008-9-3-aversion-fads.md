[Two Cueball-like guys stand together as a young guy dressed up with small ears and a tail approaches.]

Cueball: Oh God, a furry. Don't let it touch you.

[The furry hears someone call out to him.]

Off-screen: Hey, kid.

[Megan is seen preparing a kite to be flown.]

Megan: Forget those assholes. Come help me.

[The furry begins to help Megan set up the kite.]

Furry: Thanks. So you're cool with furries?

[The two are now standing far apart, the furry with the kite and the line going over to Megan.]

Megan: Well, I think your fetish is weird as hell. It just bothers me how you're this designated Internet punching bag among people who are otherwise down with weird fetishes. So I stick up for you when I can.

[The kite is now successfully up in the air, and Megan pulls the line with both hands moving backwards.]

Furry: Well, thanks. I owe you one.

Megan: It's no big deal.

[Megan stops some distance from the furry holding the line with one hand. The furry lifts one hand up apologizing.]

Furry: No, this is like the lion and the mouse.

Megan: ...Listen, can we pick a comparison less likely to turn you on?

Furry: Sorry.
