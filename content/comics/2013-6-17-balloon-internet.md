[Cueball sits on a hill reading a book.]

[Cueball remains engrossed in the book. A balloon with a box at the end of the string begins to descend behind him.]

[Cueball continues reading. The balloon is getting lower.]

[The balloon's box is now right behind Cueball's ear.]

Balloon box: *Internet*.

Cueball: Augh!

[Cueball throws the book in surprise.]

[The balloon ascends rapidly, while the startled Cueball looks up.]
