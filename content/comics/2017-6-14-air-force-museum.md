[Megan walks from left over to Cueball.]

Megan: How was your day?

Cueball: I visited the military aircraft museum over at the Air Force base. It was really neat!

[Both walking together to the right.]

Cueball: They have planes from different eras, all kinds of cool equipment, and you can even watch missiles being loaded.

[Beat frameless panel. Cueball and Megan walking.]

[Both still walking.]

Cueball: ...at least, I *hope* that was a museum.

Megan: Do you hear helicopters?
