[Cueball on the phone.]

Voice: Hey, I just got home from the party

Cueball: The one with the IRC folks?

Voice: Yeah.

Cueball: How was it?

Voice: Got too drunk. I screwed up, bad.

Cueball: What happened?

Voice: There was a girl. No idea who she was. Don't even know her name. I was too drunk to care.

Cueball: And what, you slept with her?

Voice: No.

Voice: I signed her public key.

Cueball: Shit, man.
