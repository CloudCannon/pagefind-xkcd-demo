[The cat lands with its paw on the dot, claws out.]

[The cat tugs on the dot.]

Dot: *tug tug*

[Cueball tries to use the laser pointer, which is no longer emitting a beam. The cat nibbles on the red laser dot.]

Cueball: ??? *click click*

Cat: *lick? nom nom*

[The cat arches, emitting red shock lines.]

[The cat shoots lasers out of its eyes at Cueball, who is covered in a bright red glow. The right side of the panel is the end of a thought bubble.]

[The black cat, sleeping, has dreamed the entire strip.]

Cat: *zzzzz*
