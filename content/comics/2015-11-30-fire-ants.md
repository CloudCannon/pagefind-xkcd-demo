[Cueball is talking to Hairbun, an advisor, who is sitting behind a desk.]

Cueball: I'm having second thoughts about grad school and could use some advice.

[Same setting as before. The animated advisor talks while gesticulating with her hands.]

Advisor: Consider the fire ant.

Advisor: When there's a flood, fire ants survive by joining together into giant floating rafts.

[Cueball is just standing there in the next beat-panel.]

[Back to the first setting but in a larger frame.]

Cueball: Wait, what lesson am I supposed to take from that?

Advisor: Ants are ***so cool!***

Cueball: ...You're not big on metaphors, are you.

Advisor: I am big on ants.
