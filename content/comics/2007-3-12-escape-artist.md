[Cueball sits before a computer on a desk while another man stands behind him.]

Man: I was fascinated by locks as a kid. I loved how they turned information and patterns into physical strength.

Cueball: Why does my script keep dying?

[Closeup on Cueball sitting at the computer.]

Man: And a lock invites you to try and open it. It's the hacker instinct. Only your ignorance stands in the way.

Cueball: Wait it's passing bad strings.

[Returns to the two shot of both men.]

Man: I admired Harry Houdini, how he could open any lock and free himself from any restraint.

Cueball: Ah - Bash is parsing the spaces.

Man: Sure some of it was fakery and showmanship. But I still wonder how he so consistently escaped handcuffs.

Cueball: Backslashes?

Man: Huh?

Cueball: Never mind.
