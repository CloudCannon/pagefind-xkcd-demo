[Megan is walking while an energy sphere (Sphere) floats behind her and talks to her. The sphere is black but surrounded by six outwardly-curved segments that are shaded gray. The white parts in between makes it look like it irradiates light out along these lines.]

Sphere: *Explain to me this "steroid scandal."*

[Zoom in on Megan's face while she holds a hand to her chin.]

Megan: Well, uh...

Megan: We humans are sacks of chemicals which stay alive by finding other chemicals and putting them inside us.

[Megan has turned around facing towards the Sphere to the left. She holds up one hand palm up.]

Megan: We hold contests to see which humans are fastest and strongest.

Megan: But some humans eat chemicals that make them *too* fast and strong.

[Megan still facing the Sphere holds her arms out.]

Megan: And they **win contests!**

Sphere: *That does sound bad.*

Megan: It's *awful!*
