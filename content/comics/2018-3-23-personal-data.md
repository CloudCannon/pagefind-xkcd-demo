  Do I just leave money in my mailbox? How much? How much money do they need, anyway? I guess it probably depends how the economy is doing. If stocks go up, should I leave more money in my mailbox or less?

[Cueball is talking to Ponytail and White Hat. Both of them are looking at Cueball.]

Cueball: Everyone keeps talking about "personal data." To be honest, I don't really know what it is.

Cueball: I mean, I understand the idea and know it's a thing I should protect. But it's so... abstract.

[Close-up on Ponytail.]

Ponytail: Yeah.

Ponytail: It's like "the economy." I don't really know what the economy is, if we're getting specific. I know stocks going up is good. For people who own stocks, at least.

Ponytail: Whatever "stocks" are.

[White Hat responds with his arms slightly out and palms open. Both Ponytail and Cueball are looking at him.]

White Hat: Yeah, or taxes. Everyone talks about taxes. What are they? Do I have to pay them? And to who?

Cueball: OK, wait, you definitely need to learn about that one.

Ponytail: Yeah, ideally sometime in the next few weeks.
