[Black Hat and Cueball stand in a bedroom. There is a broken mirror on the floor at Black Hat's feet.]

Black Hat: Oops. Guess this means seven more years of the illusion that my actions somehow influence the indifferent hand of probability which governs our lives.

[Black Hat looks down at the broken shards of glass on the floor.]

Cueball: Plus like half an hour of sweeping.

Black Hat: No, I think I'll leave it.

Cueball: You'll get glass in your feet.

Black Hat: Eccles. 9:2â€”All things come alike to all: to the clean, and to the unclean.

Black Hat: My fate is as these shards.

Cueball: Dude, chill. It's just a vanity mirror.

Black Hat: *All* is vanity mirrors.
