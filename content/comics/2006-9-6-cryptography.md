[Randall Munroe (drawn as Cueball) stands behind a lectern on a podium in front of a large conference audience (consisting of Cueball heads), with a poster hanging beside him.]

Randall: My cryptosystem is like any Feistel cipher, except in the S-Boxes we simply take the bitstring down, flip it, and reverse it.

[The poster reads:]

 Decryption

 <code>01101010</code>

 <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;>></code>

 <code>00110101</code>

 [inverter symbol]

 <code>11001010</code>

 [crossed arrows]

 <code>01010011</code>

[Caption below the crowd:]

I've been barred from speaking at any major cryptography conferences ever since it became clear that all my algorithms were just thinly disguised Missy Elliott songs.
