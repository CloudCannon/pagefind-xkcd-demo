[Cueball sits in front of a desk with a computer. Black Hat stands behind him.]

Cueball: This writer's strike sucks.

Black Hat: Why? You don't watch sitcoms.

[Cueball is off-panel.]

Cueball: Yeah, but it sucks having political campaigns without Jon Stewart's commentary.

Black Hat: True. I finally got sick of it a couple weeks ago.

[Black Hat points at a door. Cueball is still off-panel.]

Cueball: And you quit following the campaigns?

Black Hat: No. I kidnapped Jon Stewart to do analysis for me.

Cueball: You what?

[Black Hat is shouting at the door.]

Black Hat: He's locked in the basement.

Black Hat: Jon! Obama's leading in Iowa! Gimme a wry, witty comment on the situation!

Jon Stewart [Voice coming from door]: Please let me go. I have a family.
