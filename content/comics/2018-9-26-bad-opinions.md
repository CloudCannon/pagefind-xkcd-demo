[Cueball sits at a laptop.]

Offscreen voice: What are you doing?

Cueball: I just thought of a bad opinion someone could have, and now I'm searching to see if anyone does so I can be mad at them.

Offscreen voice: Sounds like you have a healthy relationship with the internet.

Cueball: Hey, at least I'm not this guy I just found!
