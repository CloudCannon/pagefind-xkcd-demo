  Texting should work. Unless the message is too long, in which case it gets converted to voicemails, and I think I'm locked out of my voicemail.

[White Hat is looking at a smartphone held out by Cueball.]

Cueball: I have five phone numbers for you. Which one should I use?

White Hat: That first one is my cell - you should use the Google Voice one, since it will forward to my laptop if I'm on WiFi. #5 is my work number, which just forwards to #1. #3 should always work but can't do texts.

White Hat: You can delete #4. I think.
