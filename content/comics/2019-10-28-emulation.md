[Cueball sits in an office chair at a desk typing on a laptop computer. The computers response to his typing is shown emanating from a starburst on the screen with zigzag lines between different sentences.]

Laptop: Loading... please insert disk into drive A:

Cueball: *click* There you go.

Laptop: Thank you. Wow, this disk is incredibly fast!

Cueball: Yeah, uh, it's the new model from Memorex.

Laptop: Amazing. And how is President Reagan?

Cueball: He's... He's fine.

I feel weird using old software that doesn't know it's being emulated.
