[An inset panel to the left shows Cueball getting ready to throw a tennis ball upward.]

[Cueball lies on the ground, underneath the titular brick archway, next to two halves of a brick. A pool of blood is coming from his head. Dust falls from the place in the archway where he knocked the brick from with the tennis ball. The ball, meanwhile, has rolled about a meter away.]
