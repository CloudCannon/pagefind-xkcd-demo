[[A reporter is filmed by a cameraperson while reporting on a major operation visible in the background. Helicopters and boats are active in the background.  Labels at the bottom say "Historic Salvage" and "Live"]]

[[Several smaller boats at the surface have submerged lines carrying up the front half of a massive ship.  The ship is labeled "RMS Titanic"]]

[[A hover of helicopters are hauling the now ascended front half of the Titanic.  A second hover of helicopters follows close behind with the back half. ]]

[[Both hovers of helicopters drop their respective pieces into an enormous vat of rice. ]]
