<<Crash>>

Ceiling figure: Want to feel old? Night At The Museum, Cars, Hips Don't Lie, and the Wii all turn 10 this year. Twister, Independence Day, The Rock, Pok√©mon, and Wonderwall all turn 20. And-

Hat guy: Oh my God, couldn't you at least have waited until morning? 

Ceiling figure: It's been 2016 for hours! Time is passing! 

Hat guy: I am acutely aware.
