  NASA tries to coordinate launch timing with the Care Bears' cloud castle, but unfortunately sometimes collisions with stray Care Bears are unavoidable, so they just try to make the fairings sturdy and hope for a glancing impact.

[The major stages of a rocket launch are shown, with the rocket trajectory indicated by dotted lines. Each stage is annotated with a description and an arrow. A title above the image reads 'Outline of a typical rocket launch'.]

[A rocket with two boosters is shown at the bottom left hand corner of the image taking off from a launch pad on the ground, surrounded by clouds of smoke.]

Liftoff

[The rocket ascends vertically]

Max-Q: Peak aerodynamic stress

[Separation of the two external booster rockets is shown, with the main rocket continuing to ascend vertically with a slight rightward tilt and the two boosters curving off to the right.]

Booster separation

[The main rocket stage starts to curve over to the right.]

Max-CB: Highest chance of collision with care bears

[Separation of the second rocket stage. Main rocket heads right, whilst second booster stage curves downward to meet trajectory of first booster stages.]

Main stage separation

[Main rocket continues towards the right.]

GPS silenced so it will stop saying "make a U-turn"

[First and second stage booster rocket trajectories meet and become a single trajectory heading upwards and right.]

Reunification

[Trajectory of main rocket wobbles slightly.]

Pilot panics, copilot takes command after struggle

[Booster stage rockets continue to head upwards and right towards the main rocket trajectory.]

Pursuit phase

[Main rocket and booster stage trajectories meet and cross three times.]

Inter-stage dogfight

[The trajectory for one of the stages ends in an explosion.]

[The remaining trajectory, indicated with dashed-lines and question marks, continues towards the right and off the edge of the page.]

 Winner proceeds to space
