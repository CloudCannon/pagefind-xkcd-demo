  Fortunately, after a brief skirmish, I seem to have gained the upper hand in the battle against my internal organs, at least until they learn to read and find out the mean stuff I've said about them.

[Cueball is seated on an medical examination table, clutching his stomach, while Ponytail stands dressed in a doctor's coat holding a file on a clipboard in her left hand.]

Ponytail: Well, we zapped you with energy beams, and it looks like one of your stupid organs is a traitor.

Cueball: ...which one?

Ponytail: I dunno, appendix? Gallbladder? One of the little ones that sucks.

Cueball: What should I do?

[Closeup on Ponytail. She holds her left hand in a clenched fist.]

Ponytail: You could quash the revolt with the ruthless deployment of chemical and biological weapons.

Cueball (off-screen): ...antibiotics?

Ponytail: But certain victory comes only through *the sword*.

Cueball (off-screen): Surgery.

[Closeup on Ponytail with her fists raised.]

Ponytail: While we're inside, we'll look around-if we see any signs of insurrection elsewhere, we will not hesitate to act. There can be no armistice. Your parts must fall in line or be crushed.

Cueball (off-screen): Um.

[Zoom out again to the entire scene. Ponytail points her left hand up.]

Ponytail: When the battle is won, we will salt your abdomen so no new organs can ever sprout up to trouble you again.

Cueball: Maybe I should get a second opinion.

Ponytail: Only if you care what a *weaker* doctor would say.
