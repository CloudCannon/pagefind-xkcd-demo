  Honestly feel a little sheepish about the amount of time and effort I spent confirming "yes, the vaccine helps protect people from getting sick and dying" but I guess everyone needs a hobby.

[White Hat is talking to Cueball.]

White Hat: I've been hearing about vaccines.

White Hat: But I decided to do my *own* research.

[In a frame-less panel White Hat continues to talk to Cueball.]

White Hat: So I spent months on the Internet reading hundreds of studies.

[Close up of White Hat as he speaks to Cueball, who replies from off-panel.]

White Hat: And wow, I gotta say,

White Hat: these vaccines are pretty good.

Cueball (off-panel): Oh, really.

[Zoomed back out, to White Hat and Cueball talking.]

White Hat: Yeah, seems like it'd be great if lots of people got them.

White Hat: Is anyone working on that?

Cueball: There's been some effort.

White Hat: Okay, cool.
