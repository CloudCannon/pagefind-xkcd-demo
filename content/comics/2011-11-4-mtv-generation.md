[[One of them damn kids that won't get OFF MY LAWN plays with some gadgetamabob while ignoring every damn thing around him off in the background.  Person 1 with a white hat, along with another person with long hair is in the foreground]]

Person 1: See, that's the problem with the MTV generation - no attention span.

Person 2: You know, that phrase referred to the 12-19 demographic that formed the core MTV audience in the mid-1980s.

Person 1: Uh huh. So?

Person 2: That generation's now in their 40s.

[[Person 1 scratches their head]]

Person 1: That can't be right.

Person 2: Face it: your problem with the MTV generation is their *kids*.
