[Teenager playing with phone walks in background. White Hat and Megan are in the foreground.]

White Hat: See, that's the problem with the MTV generationâ€” No attention span.

Teenager's phone: *Bleep bloop*

[White Hat and Megan in frameless panel without teenager from previous panel.]

Megan: You know, that phrase referred to the 12-19 demographic that formed the core MTV audience in the mid-1980s.

[Zoom in on Megan with White Hat off-panel to the left.]

White Hat (off-panel): Uh huh? So?

Megan: That generation's now in their 40s.

[Zoom back out to White Hat and Megan, with White Hat scratching his head and looking away.]

White Hat: That can't be right.

Megan: Face it: Your problem with the MTV generation is their *kids*.
