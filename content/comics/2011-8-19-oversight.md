[[A couple has sex up against a wall.]]

[[A couple has sex standing in an armchair.]]

[[A couple has sex in a swing, swaying above a table with a flower vase on it.]]

[[Screenshot of Fitocracy. In the text field marked "log your workout for today," the user has filled in "sex," and the site has returned the message "activity not found."]]
