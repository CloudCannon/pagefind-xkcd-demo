Mildly sleazy uses of Facebook, part 14:

Looking up someone's profile before introducing yourself so you know which of your favorite bands to mention

Cueball: Favorite bands? Hmm...

Cueball: Maybe Regina Spektor or the Polyphonic Spree.

Megan: Whoa, those are two of my favorites, too!

Megan: Clearly, we should have sex.

Cueball: Okay! My favorite position is the retrograde wheelbarrow.

Megan: Ohmygod, mine too!
