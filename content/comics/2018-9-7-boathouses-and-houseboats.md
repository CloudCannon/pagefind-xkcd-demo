  The <x> that is held by <y> is also a <y><x>, so if you go to a food truck, the stuff you buy is truck food. A phone that's in your car is a carphone, and a car equipped with a phone is a phonecar. When you play a mobile racing game, you're in your phonecar using your carphone to drive a different phonecar. I'm still not sure about bananaphones.

[A chart with three rows and three columns is shown, both with the same heading "car", "house", and "boat". On the top left a text with the word "this" two times embedded in a bubble and an arrow respectively pointing to the row and column heading reads:]

A **this** that holds **this**

[Most entries have the common word in black, but crossed out in red with another word below also in red. Two entries remain in green.]

A Car that holds a Car: <s>Tow truck</s> Carcar

A House that holds a Car: <s>Garage</s> Carhouse

A Boat that holds a Car: <s>Car ferry</s> Carboat

A Car that holds a House: <s>Mobile home</s> Housecar

A House that holds a House: <s>Apartment</s> Househouse

A Boat that holds a House: Houseboat (green text)

A Car that holds a Boat: <s>Boat trailer</s> Boatcar

A House that holds a Boat: Boathouse (green text)

A Boat that holds a Boat: <s>Lifeboat</s> Boatboat

[Caption below the frame:]

I really like the words for "boathouse" and "houseboat" and think we should apply that scheme more consistently.
