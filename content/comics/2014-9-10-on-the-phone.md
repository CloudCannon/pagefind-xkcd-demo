[Megan is pointing off-panel to the left and looking off-panel to the right.]

Megan: Why is there a teapot in the bathroom?

Off-panel voice (right): Sorry. When I'm on the phone I always zone out and pick stuff up and carry it around.

[Megan is in front of an open fridge, holding a hammer.]

Megan: There's a hammer in the fridge.

Off-panel voice: Another phone call. I was just fidgeting.

[Megan is walking next to four stacks of household objects: the first has a lightbulb on top of a book, the second has a blender on top of three books, the third has five books (two balanced vertically) with a smaller rectangular object on top, and the fourth has two tennis balls on top of three books.]

Megan: Did you put all our stuff in weird stacks?

Off-panel voice: Long call. Sorry.

[Megan, outside, looks up at a towering straight-sided object.]

Megan: ...Why is there a giant obelisk in the backyard?

Off-panel voice: Phone again. My bad.

Megan: It's carved with prayers to "Ba'al, the Soul-Eater."

Off-panel voice: Haha! I'm so absentminded.
