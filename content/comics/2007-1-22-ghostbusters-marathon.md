[Cueball and a friend are in a room. Cueball is standing up. There is litter around them.]

Cueball: Okay, that's all the Ghostbusters marathon I can handle. Later!

Friend: You can't leave! We just started the animated series!

Cueball: I've had my fill. I'm going home.

Friend: I can't let you do that.

[Cueball walks along a cord and past a box. The friend clicks a switch.]

*Click*

[Cueball is bathed in some kind of aura emitted by the box.]
