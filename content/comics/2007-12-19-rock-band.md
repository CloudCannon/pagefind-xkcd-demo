  I'm gonna have to add something to the strum bar so it makes a clicky sound like the old controllers. I'm so used to the feedback; the silence throws me off.

[Three people are playing Rock Band, one on guitar, another on drums, and the last on vocals. Music notes float above them. Cueball with arms crossed is looking at them.]

Cueball: You know, playing this doesn't make you cool like a real rock band.

Cueball: Guys?

Cueball: Didn't you hear me?

Cueball: Stop having fun!
