**on the other side of the world**

**a new style of street racing**

**rules the tokyo underground**

**the cars are lighter**

**the tires are slick**

**when you drift,**

**if you ain't out of control,**

**you ain't in control.**

**and if you work the wheel**

**back and forth just right,**

[Two cars race around a corner with blue sparks spraying from their tires.]

**You get blue sparks.**

The FAST and the FURIOUS: *TOKYO DASH!!*
