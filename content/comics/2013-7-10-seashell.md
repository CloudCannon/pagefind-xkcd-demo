  This is roughly equivalent to 'number of times I've picked up a seashell at the ocean' / 'number of times I've picked up a seashell', which in my case is pretty close to 1, and gets much closer if we're considering only times I didn't put it to my ear.

[At the top of the panel is an equation showing Bayes' Theorem for the probability that a person is near the ocean given that they just picked up a seashell.]

P(I'm near the ocean|I picked up a seashell) =

P(I picked up a seashell|I'm near the ocean)P(I'm near the ocean)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

P(I picked up a seashell)

[The probability that I'm near the ocean given I picked up a seashell equals the probability I picked up a seashell given I'm near the ocean times the probability I'm near the ocean all divided by the probability I picked up a seashell.]

[Cueball holds a seashell and stands to the left of the panel, to the right, a few birds are flying around and the sound of a wave crashing against the shore is depicted.]

*Crashhh* *Sploosh*

Statistically speaking, if you pick up a seashell and *don't* hold it to your ear, you can probably hear the ocean.
