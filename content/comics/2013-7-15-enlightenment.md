[The two Internet Bodhisattvas Ponytail and Cueball lecture Megan encircled by a wheel placed upon the ground.]

Ponytail: To achieve **internet enlightenment**, you must free yourself from insecurity.

Megan: But insecurity keeps me humble!

[Ponytail continues talking.]

Ponytail: No. Insecurity leads to conceit. Conceit leads to judgment.

Ponytail: Judgment leads to being an asshole.
