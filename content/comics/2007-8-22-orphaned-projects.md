[Voices are coming from behind a door with a sign that reads "Debian Linux HQ."]

First voice: Problem: One of the volunteer developers has a date this weekend. Dates lead to romance. Romance leads to orphaned projects.

Second voice: What's the plan?

First voice: We're hiring him a relationship coach. He's like Will Smith in "Hitch," but he only gives bad advice.

[Black Hat is talking to Cueball, who is standing in front of a mirror.]

Black Hat: Okay, remember: The key to conversation is <u>constructive</u> <u>criticism</u>.

Black Hat: You need to show you're smart enough to solve her problems.

Cueball: Makes sense.
