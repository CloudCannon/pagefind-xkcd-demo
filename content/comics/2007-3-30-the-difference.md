[All the panels are circular.]

[Cueball pulls a lever.]

*Pull*

[Lightning hits Cueball.]

*ZAP*

[Cueball still stands, obviously battered.]

[An arrow labelled "normal person" points to a panel of Cueball thinking.]

Cueball (thinking): I guess I shouldn't do that.

[An arrow labelled "scientist" points to a panel of Cueball about to pull the level again.]

Cueball (thinking): I wonder if that happens every time.
