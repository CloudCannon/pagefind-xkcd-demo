[White Hat and Cueball are walking.]

White Hat: ...No, but see, it's a movie *about* movies.

Cueball: Sounds like masturbatory navel-gazing.

[Close-up of White Hat.]

White Hat: No, it's about blurring the line between metaphor and reality.

White Hat: You just don't know much about art.

Cueball: *Seriously?*

[White Hat and Cueball are standing.]

Cueball: I know *all* about blurring the line between metaphor and reality. I'm the goddamn *Michael Jordan* of blurring the line between metaphor and reality.

White Hat: ...Huh?

[A basketball appears from nowhere and hits White Hat in the head.]
