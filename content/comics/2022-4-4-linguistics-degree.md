[Megan, who is wearing a graduation cap, receives a degree which is handed to her by Hairbun. They are standing on a podium with Ponytail and Cueball standing below as onlookers.]

Hairbun: Congratulations on the degree! Your word is "Bassoon."

Ponytail: Oh nice! Not as cool as my "Jackalope," but still not bad.

Cueball: You all are lucky. I'm stuck with "Slurp."
