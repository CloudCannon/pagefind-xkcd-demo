[A devil, Mephistopheles (according to the [official transcript](https://xkcd.com/533/info.0.json)), with bald head horns, tail with arrow ending, a trident in one hand and a paper in the other hand is ready to welcome Hairbun to hell. Above Mephistopheles there are three large stalactite hanging down and behind Hairbun there is one very large stalagmite and three small and also two small stalactites.]

Mephistopheles: Welcome to Hell. Here'sâ€”

Mephistopheles:Wait. I know you.

[Zoom in on the two, with white background. Mephistopheles trident breaks the panels frame.]

Mephistopheles: You're the Fujitsu exec who killed the Q-series.

Hairbun: ...Yes?

Mephistopheles: The Q2010 was the perfect laptop!

[In this frame-less panel with white background Mephistopheles walks away from Hairbun trident pointing up and left. Hairbun throws her arms out to the side.]

Mephistopheles: Powerful, durable, had every feature, and made the Air look <u>bulky</u>. And that was back in 2006!

Hairbun: But no one bought it!

Mephistopheles: Then you marketed it wrong!

[Mephistopheles turns around towards Hairbun who both standing as in the first panel but still with white background.]

Hairbun: Wait. Don't you *encourage* evil acts down here?

Mephistopheles: In theory, yes, but we need laptops too!

Mephistopheles: Although it's moot, since we have an exclusive deal with Sony.

Hairbun: I *knew* it!
