[Cueball is looking at his smartphone while a friend calls to him from off-panel. Cueball is thinking as indicated with a thought bubble.]

Off-screen voice: Hey, what's the temperature outside?

Cueball (thinking): Should I give it in 째F or 째C?

[Zoom in on Cueballs head with a list of reason to use Celsius above him:]

**Degrees Celsius**

\* International standard

\* Helps reduce America's weird isolationism

\* Nice how "negative" means below freezing

\* Physics major loyalty

\* Easier to spell

\* We lost a Mars probe over this crap

[Same view of Cueballs head, but wider frame to accommodate a broader a list of reason to use Fahrenheit:]

**Degrees Fahrenheit**

\* 0째F to 100째F good match for temperature range in which most humans live

\* Rounds more usefully (70's, 90's)

\* Unit-aware computing makes imperial less annoying

\* SI prefixes are less relevant for temperatures

\* Fahrenheit is likely more clear in this context

\* Valuing unit standardization over being helpful possibly makes me a bad friend

[Cueball is holding his smartphone down while thinking as indicated with another thought bubble floating at the top. He then speaks and gets a reply from his off-panel friend.]

Cueball (thinking): Crap, gotta pick something. Uhh...

Cueball: ...0.173 radians.

Off-screen voice: I'll just go check myself
