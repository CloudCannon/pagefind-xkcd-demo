[Cueball and Megan are standing beside each other in what is presumably a museum, and are viewing a stegosaurus skeleton. The skeleton stands on a pedestal and there is a placard on a stand in front of it.  The rib cage and head of the skeleton are visible to us; the rear of the skeleton is outside the frame of the panel.]

[Panel of just Cueball and Megan.]

Cueball: Wow.

[Cueball and Megan standing.]

Cueball: Rocks used to be ***so cool***.
