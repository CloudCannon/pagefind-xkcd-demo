[Margaret, shown in full body, is alone. She is talking while looking out towards the reader.]

Margaret: Are you there, God? It's me, Margaret.

Margaret: I know you're listening.

[Zoom in on her face and torso.]

Margaret: Are you scared, God?

Margaret: Are you?

[Zooming so far in that not even her whole face is visible.]

Margaret: You should be.

[Zooming far out showing her in a white silhouette against a black sky, standing on the white earth.]

Margaret: *Margaret is coming for you*.
