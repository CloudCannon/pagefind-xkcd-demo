[Ponytail is looking at her phone while talking to Cueball.]

Ponytail: Why did you post a *The Wheels on the Bus* Youtube video to Facebook six times?

Cueball: Haha, whoops! My daughter was watching the tablet and must have hit something.

[Cueball is talking to someone on the phone while pushing a shopping cart with a few items in it.]

Phone: Hey, did you mean to post "FHFF,,,M,,,," and a link to a map of hardware stores?

Cueball: I should really look up how to lock the screen.

[White Hat is holding his phone while walking with Cueball.]

White Hat: You just posted videos on metal-working, zip lines, and camouflage.

Cueball: Uhh...

[Ponytail is looking at her phone while talking to Cueball.]

Ponytail: Um, you posted blueprints of the Crown Jewel rooms in the Tower of London.

Cueball: Maybe we should be keeping more of an eye on her.
