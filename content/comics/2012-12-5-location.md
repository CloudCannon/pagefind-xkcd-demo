[Three people around a computer. One of them is typing.]

Typing: Hey, party tonight?

Typing: We'd all love to come see your new place!

Reply (through monitor): Wait, what?

[Cut to guy sitting at a laptop.]

Reply (through the guy's monitor): We want to hang out!

Guy typing: We're not, like, good friends.

Reply (through the guy's monitor): I know, but we were thinking about it and we really like you!

[Cut back to the three friends.]

Typing: You should have us over tonight!

Typing: For, like, an hour.

Typing: It'll be fun!

Reply (through monitor): Well, uh, sure.

[Cut to color-inverted image of the guy's house. Four Enlightened-controlled Ingress portals are in the guy's back yard.]

Friends (off-screen): *YESSSS!*

Guy (from inside his house): I still don't get why you're suddenly so excited to hang out.
