[Circe is speaking to Odysseus.]

Circe: Remember, Odysseus:

Circe: As you pass the rocks you will hear a woman calling out to you, urging you to stray from your path, but plug your ears and hold your course, for her beguiling lies will draw you to a watery grave.

Circe: I don't know *why* they can't just fix it. I keep filing error reports.

[Caption below the panel:]

Circe was actually just telling Odysseus to ignore his GPS.
