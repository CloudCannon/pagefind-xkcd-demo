  Curdled milk, of a peculiar kind, made after a Bulgarian recipe and called "yaghurt," is now a Parisian fad and is believed to be a remedy against growing old. A correspondent who has tried it, says he would prefer to die young. (1905, The Elk Falls Journal)

[Six individuals in clothing representing early 1900s' American fashion stand in a line.  Four of them have speaking roles, from left to right, and two stand in silence, contributing to the feeling of a conversation amongst a crowd gathered around the first speaker]

Speaker 1 (white brim hat): Now, it may sound strange, but it's how Gen Z is doing things!

Speaker 2 (wavy hair, dress with belt): Gosh!  Is that really true??

Speaker 3 (dark hat with indent): Ridiculous.  It just goes to show what I've been saying about them.

Speaker 4 (hair in bun, dress with lace hem): Now now, maybe we just need to change with the times.

[Caption below comic:]

People ascribing qualities to "Gen Z" have the same energy as small-town salespeople in 1905 talking about what the ladies in Paris are up to.
