[Cueball and Megan are walking together.]

Cueball: We're almost at the *Back to the Future* date.

[Diagram showing a timeline from before 1980 to about 2020. Markers on the line indicate the release date of *Return of the Jedi*, the release date of *The Phantom Menace*, and May 13th, with arrows showing the intervals in between these three points.]

Megan: On May 13th, *The Phantom Menace* will have come out closer to *Return of the Jedi* than to the present

[Cueball and Megan stop walking. Megan is in a reflective pose with her hand on her chin.]

Cueball: It's weird how I'm constantly surprised by the passage of time when it's literally the most predictable thing in the universe.

Megan: You know, "A long time ago" should have "Plus four more decades" added in rereleases.
