  They'll pick music and culture that they know annoys you. Building in behavioral easter eggs is a fair retaliation!

[In a frame crossing the top border of the first panel of the comic:]

The future

[Cueball is sitting at a futuristic desktop computer with the curved screen and keyboard both floating above the table, and a girl with pigtails is standing behind him with a portable ultra-thin screen. She shows the screen to Cueball. On it is a man with dark hair.]

Girl: Hey dad, look at this old music video.

Video: We're no strangers to love...

Cueball: Wow, you got me.

[The girl now looks at the device.]

Girl: Did your generation really use this to troll people? *So* lame. You know, you guys **sucked** at pranks.

[The girl is holding the device down along her legs as Cueball turns from his computer and addresses her.]

Cueball: Did we? I once raised a kid with conditioning so her speech centers shut down when she was upset.

[The girl has dropped the device on the floor and is balling her hands into fists. Cueball has turned back and is typing on the keyboard.]

Girl: What? No, you couldn't have bleegle warble yargle arrgh!

Cueball: Teehee.
