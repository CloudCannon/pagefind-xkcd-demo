[A not-very-realistic view of the universe, in profile. To the left, a sectional view of the Earth, with its Moon and few clouds overhead, and a little Cueball standing, looking up. Extending to the right of the Earth, various stellar objects: some planets, some spaceships, another galaxy. Above them, on an artistically jagged white background, somewhat like a torn piece of paper, this text:]

<big>A God's Lament</big>



Some said the world should be in Perl;

Some said in Lisp.

But I fear we passed to men

A disappointing founding myth,

And should we write it all again,

I'd end it with

A close-paren.



[To the right of the "various stellar objects", as if paired with the Earth at their left to bracket them, is a giant close parenthesis:]
