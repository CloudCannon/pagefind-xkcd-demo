[[A figure and two women stand on a hill around two bare trees.]]

Woman: One day a year, the sun sets directly between these two trees.

Figure: Oh, cool - like the Manhattan thing. 

[[The figure stands alone in thought.]]

[[We see a close-up of the three of them. The sun shines behind them.]]

Figure: Wait, isn't that true every day for pretty much any two trees? 

Other woman: Shh, here it comes! 

[[The sun is lower in the sky. The first woman holds a net on a pole, while the other has a bag.]]

Figure: Wait, what? 

Woman: OK, Got the bag? 

Other woman: Yup, grab it! 

Woman: We're gonna be rich!
