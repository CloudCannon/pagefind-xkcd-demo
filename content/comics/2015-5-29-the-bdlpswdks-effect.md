Ponytail: The Bernoulli-Doppler-Leidenfrost-Peltzman-Sapir-Whorf-Dunning-Kruger-Stroop Effect states that if a speeding fire truck lifts off and hurtles towards you on a layer of superheated gas, you'll dive out of the way faster if the driver screams ***"red!"*** in a ***non***-tonal language that ***has*** a word for "firefighter" than if they scream ***"green!"*** in a ***tonal*** language with ***no*** word for "firefighter" which you ***think*** you're fluent in but ***aren't***.
