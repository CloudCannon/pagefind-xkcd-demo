[Megan and Black Hat are sitting in front of their laptops.]

Megan: Ever hear of the Kola Borehole?

Black Hat: Noâ€”what's that?

Megan: A Soviet project to drill deep into the Earth's crust.

Megan: There's a hoax report claiming that their drill broke through into a superhot cavern, and when they lowered a microphone into the hole, they heard tormented screaming. People say that's why the miners sealed the well and abandoned the project.

Black Hat: Why would anyone *believe* that story?

Megan: I guess some people think Hell is literally an underground place.

Black Hat: No - I mean, why would the miners seal the opening? Why not just dig a canal connecting it to the ocean? Unless they ***like*** Hell.

Megan: ...If there's ever a war between Earth and Hell, I hope I'm on ***your*** side.

Black Hat: You seem nice; you probably won't be.
