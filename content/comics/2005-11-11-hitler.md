[Black Hat and Cueball are talking together in the same position in all four panels.]

Cueball: Learning about the Holocaust has really shaken my belief in God.

Black Hat: You know, as a young man, Hitler was rejected from art school.

Cueball: Yeah... shame he didn't get in.

Black Hat: Well, have you seen any of his paintings? They're <u>awful</u>. Defy all rules of composition.

Cueball: What are you suggesting?

Black Hat: Maybe there <u>is</u> a god, but he's a real art lover.

Cueball: This is why I don't go out in public with you.
