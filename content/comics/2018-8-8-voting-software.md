[Heading above the panel]:

Asking building engineers about elevator safety:

Cueball: Elevators are protected by multiple tried-and-tested failsafe mechanisms. They're nearly incapable of falling.

[Ponytail is holding a handheld microphone and interviewing Megan and Cueball, standing in a line]

[Heading above the panel]:

Asking software engineers about computerized voting:

Megan: That's *terrifying*.

[Zoomed in on Ponytail, Megan and Cueball's faces]

Ponytail: Wait, really?

Megan: Don't trust voting software and don't listen to anyone who tells you it's safe.

Ponytail: Why?

Megan: I don't quite know how to put this, but our entire field is bad at what we do, and if you rely on us, everyone will die.

[Zoomed back out, showing Ponytail, Megan and Cueball standing in a line]

Ponytail: They say they've fixed it with something called "blockchain."

Megan: AAAAA!!!

Cueball: Whatever they sold you, don't touch it.

Megan: Bury it in the desert.

Cueball: Wear gloves.
