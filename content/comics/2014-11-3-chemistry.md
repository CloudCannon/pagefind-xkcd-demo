[A large capital letter "H", with faint gray circles drawn on the ends of each of the four legs.]

Hydrogen can form four bonds. It readily bonds with itself, and often exists as a crystal.

[A lattice of several H's, all "bonded" together at the ends of their legs in a crisscross, meshlike pattern, labeled:]

Crystalline hydrogen

[A large capital letter "C", with faint gray circles drawn on both ends of the arc.]

Carbon can only form two bonds. It readily bonds with hydrogen to form C<sub>2</sub>H (mydrane) or itself.

[A large capital letter "O".]

Oxygen is inert, forming no bonds...

[Image of several lone O's, none connected to anything, labeled:]

Monatomic oxygen gas.
