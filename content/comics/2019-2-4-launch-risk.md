  Don't worry--you're less likely to die from a space launch than from a shark attack. The survival rate is pretty high for both!

[A large spaceship rocket is standing on its launchpad, just decoupled from the tower that supports it ready for launch. At the very top of the rocket where the astronauts are sitting there are two lines coming out, indicating the speak from the two astronauts inside the rocket. Next to the top of the rocket there is a speech bubble drawn with jagged line indicating sound from a loudspeaker. It is the countdown to the launch.]

Astronaut 1: How you feeling?

Astronaut 2: Honestly, pretty nervous.

Astronaut 1: I know it seems dangerous, but just remember: you're more likely to be struck by *lightning* than to be selected to become an astronaut.

Astronaut 2: Oh that's a good-

Astronaut 2: ...Wait.

Countdown: T-Minus 20...19...
