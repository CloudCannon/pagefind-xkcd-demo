  I'd like to find a corpus of writing from children in a non-self-selected sample (e.g. handwritten letters to the president from everyone in the same teacher's 7th grade class every year)--and score the kids today versus the kids 20 years ago on various objective measures of writing quality. I've heard the idea that exposure to all this amateur peer practice is hurting us, but I'd bet on the generation that conducts the bulk of their social lives via the written word over the generation that occasionally wrote book reports and letters to grandma once a year, any day.

[White Hat and Cueball are walking together, White Hat is holding a newspaper or report.]

White Hat: Weird- Another study found that kids who use SMS abbreviations actually score *higher* on grammar and spelling tests.

Cueball: Why on *earth* is that a surprise?

[Cueball turns to White hat (who is now out side the frame. Inserted in the frame is a panel showing several kids throwing balls.]

Cueball: Imagine kids suddenly start playing catch literally *all the time*. Everywhere they go, they throw balls back and forth, toss them in the air, and hurl them at trees and signs- Nearly every waking hour of their lives.

[Cueball talks on while White Hat begins to walk.]

Cueball: Do you think their generation will suck at baseball because they learned sloppy skills?

White Hat: ...So you think someone will become a great writer while *sexting?*

[They walk together.]

Cueball: Have you *read* James Joyce's love letters? The phrases "My little fuckbird" and "Arse full of farts" appear. If we want to write *Ulysses*, our generation may not be sexting *enough*.

White Hat: Eww.
