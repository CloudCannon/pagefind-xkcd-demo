  The weak twin primes conjecture states that there are infinitely many pairs of primes. The strong twin primes conjecture states that every prime p has a twin prime (p+2), although (p+2) may not look prime at first. The tautological prime conjecture states that the tautological prime conjecture is true.

[[In the center of the panel are the large words 'GOLDBACH CONJECTURES'. Around it are six boxes: two above it, and two on each side, one below the other. They read:

Weak: Every odd number greather than 5 is the sum of three primes.

Strong: Every even number greater than 2 is the sum of two primes.

Very weak: Every number greater than 7 is the sum of two other numbers.

Very strong: Every odd number is prime.

Extremely weak: Numbers just 

keep going

.

Extremely strong: There are no numbers above 7.
