[Megan and Cueball are sitting in a field under a clear blue sky and bright Sun.]

Megan: I love sitting out under the stars.

Cueball: ...It's daytime.

Megan: Yeah, but the stars are all still up there.

Megan: Constellations wheel overhead; they're just painted over with blue.

Megan: Every sky is full of stars.

Cueball: That's somehow terrifying.

Megan: It's okay—just look at that sunny sky and tell yourself space isn't real.

Megan: "Daytime" is us closing our eyes and pretending it makes infinity go away.
