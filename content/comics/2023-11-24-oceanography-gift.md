  Shipping times vary. Same-ocean delivery may only take a few years, but delivery from the Weddell Sea in Antarctica may take multiple decades, and molecules meant for inland seas like the Mediterranean may be returned as undeliverable by surface currents.

[Cueball and Megan are standing thigh deep, at either edge of a stretch of water between two steep but walkable shorelines.]

[Cueball, at the left, is apparently opening bottles of water and pouring them into the sea while recording himself.]

Cueball: Happy birthday!

Cueball: I got you these water molecules.

[Sound effects:] (click) (pour)

[The water between has a morass of short swirling arrows indicating movement. In the air above this there is a square-bracketted 'label']

[Label:] 10 years pass <!-- Written like this in response to the possibility that Randall is trolling us, or causing us inconvenience, by using our "transscript format for a description" actually \*in\* the literal text... -->

[Megan, at the right, is dipping bottles into the water to fill them]

Megan: Aww, thank you!

[Sound effect:] (scoop)

[Text below comic:]

 Global surface ocean connectivity times are ≤10 years (Jönsson & Watson, 2016, DOI:10.1038/ncomms11239), so if you're willing to plan ahead, you can pour water into the ocean while wishing someone a happy birthday, and then in 10 years let them know they can pick up their gift at the nearest coastline.
