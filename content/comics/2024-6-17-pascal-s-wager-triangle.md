  In contrast to Pascal's Wager Triangle, Pascal's Triangle Wager argues that maybe God wants you to draw a triangle of numbers where each one is the sum of the two numbers above it, so you probably should, just in case.

[Cueballs, each holding some document, are shown in a triangular arrangement, with arrows pointing from upper to lower Cueballs:]

[At the top, row 1 has a Cueball, unnamed but described below as "C1", holding a piece of paper with a crossed-square shape possibly resembling a Punnet Square diagram and with a speech-bubble]

C1: Hey, you two below me! Here's a proof that you should believe in my god!

[Two arrows lead diagonally down-left and down-right from C1 to the second row, having two similarly drawn Cueballs (differing only by slight changes in pose) described here as "C2" and "C3"]

C2 & C3: I'm convinced! Hey, you two below me! Here's a proof that you should believe in my god!

[Two arrows lead down from each of Row 2's Cueballs to three similar Cueballs on Row 3, "C4", "C5" and "C6", the central Cueball being the target of arrows from both of the predecessors, and the speech-bubbles partly obscuring the predecessor Cueballs and the lines of the arrows]

C4 & C6: I'm convinced! Hey, you two below me! Here's a proof that you should believe in my god!

C5: Ok, I believe you both! Hey, you two below me! Here's a proof that you should believe in my **two** gods!

[Two further arrows lead down from each Row 3 Cueball to a total of four Row 4 Cueballs, all but the edge ones having two incoming arrows, "C7" to "C10"]

C7: I'm convinced! Hey, you two below me! Here's a proof that you should believe in my god!

C8 & C9: Ok, I believe you both! Hey, you two below me! Here's a proof that you should believe in my **three** gods!

[C10 has no visible bubble, as there is no room for one in-frame, and is itself also slightly obscured by C9's bubble, but would logically be considered to have a "believe in my (singular) god" monologue]

[Continuing the pattern, Row 5 has "C11" to "C15" Cueballs (with only a small amount of leg visible above the lower edge of the comic frame), each is led to by diagonal arrow(s) originating from the Row4 Cueballs]

[C11 and C15 have no visible speech bubbles, due to being even more edge-adjacent and C15 even reaching off the edge of the frame with his 'punnet paper', but can be assumed to have a "believe in my god" statement]

C12 & C14: Ok, I believe you both! Hey, you two below me! Here's a proof that you should believe in my **four** gods!

C13: Ok, I believe you both! Hey, you two below me! Here's a proof that you should believe in my **six** gods!

[No further arrows or Cueballs can be visible, and no further speech-bubbles obscure Row 5, but without any reason to believe they aren't just off frame]
