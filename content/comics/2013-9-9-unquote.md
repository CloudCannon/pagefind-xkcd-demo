[[Two figures with spiky hair and backpacks are conversing. One is riding in a hover-car, or similar.]]

Standing figure: Bye! 

Riding figure: May the Force be with you!

Standing figure: Huh?

Riding figure: It's just something my grandma used to say. No idea what it means.

I wonder on what date Star Wars will be quoted for the last time.
