[Cueball is talking to Black Hat. Black Hat is using a laptop.]

Cueball: They said on the news that they found a giant ring lying in a field outside Chicago. Strung with some kind of superstrong mesh.

Black Hat: Mhm?

Cueball: Then they found a 260 mile long shaft connected to the ring, running from Chicago to St. Louis. In St. Louis they found a gigantic winch.

Black Hat: Did they.

Cueball: It sounds kind of like...

Cueball: ...a butterfly net.

Cueball: ...are you planning on catching the International Space Station?

Black Hat: I'm planning to catch ***an*** international space station.

<sub>Black Hat: Not sayin' which.</sub>
