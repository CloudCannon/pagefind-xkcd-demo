  By my count, only 48 of the 158 minutes in Live Free or Die Hard have action. That's pathetic, guys. Crank is better, but needs a bigger budget and more Summer Glau.

[Cueball and Megan are talking together as they walk away from a cinema.]

Cueball: Another summer gone without a mindless big-budget action movie.

Megan: Huh? *Die Hard* was nothing <u>but</u> action!

Cueball: No, it was too talky.

Megan: What? Too <u>talky</u>?

Cueball: I tallied it minute-by-minute. It's at least 60% people walking and talking. <u>All</u> those movies are.

Cueball: Just once, I want a real action movie. 30 seconds of exposition followed by a perfect 90-minute action scene. One with a huge budget, a good choreographer, and a great director.

Megan: And they should center it around some character we already know, someone we never get tired of watching.

Cueball: I think we've got something here...

 Coming this summer

 River Tam

 Beats Up Everyone

[The poster shows a line of doorways. In the background, numerous people are lying on the ground or draped over doorways and windows. River Tam is doing a flying kick into someone's face, and another person is emerging from the doorway closest to the viewer.]
