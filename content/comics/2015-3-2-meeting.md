  Here at CompanyName.website, our three main strengths are our web-facing chairs, our huge collection of white papers, and the fact that we physically cannot die.

[Beret Guy is shown in silhouette. Above Beret Guy there is a black sign with white (and grey) text. Above this is his address to those in the meeting:]

Beret Guy: Welcome to a meeting! I'm almost out of words, so I'll keep this short. Just wanna touch bases.

[White text in the black sign (*.website* in grey):]

[Beret Guy stands in front of an office chair and a table talking.]

Beret Guy: First, a few updates. We've learned from the state police that the self-driving car project we launched by accident during this morning's carpool has come to an end about 90 miles outside of town. Very exciting!

[Pony tail sits at the table.]

Beret Guy [off-panel]: Profits are up. Sales, any luck figuring out who our customers are?

Ponytail: Nope. Money keeps appearing, but we have no idea how or why.

Beret Guy [off-panel]: Great!

[Back to the situation from frame two.]

Beret Guy: Oh, and one last thing—I saw a cool red beetle in the hall. Can someone add it to the bug tracker?

[person off-panel]: Just did!

Beret Guy: Thanks!
