[Megan and a man with a thinning head of hair are talking, looking at a group of two men and a woman standing further away. The woman is on a table and the two men are looking at her.]

Guy: I love that girl. She's not afraid to be quirky and different.

Megan: You know, I'm active in street theatre and I collect and paint Asian dolls.

Guy: ...Okay, I didn't actually mean be different. I just want silly and entertaining on command now and then.
