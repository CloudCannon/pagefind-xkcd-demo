Event description: Roughly **18 hours** prior to the incident, an Amazon package containing fireworks was mistakenly delivered to the reactor control room and left under the console.

The next day, at approximately **14:00**, Technician A arrived at the facility with a bag containing four juggling pins. At **14:20**, Technician A entered the control room, and joined Technician B at the console.

At **14:28**, Technician C exited the elevator and approached the control room holding a birthday cake intended for Technician B.

At **14:29:22**, Technician A said "Hey [Technician B], check out this cool trick I learned" while taking out the juggling pins. Technician B turned to look just as, at **14:29:26**, Technician C entered holding the cake.
