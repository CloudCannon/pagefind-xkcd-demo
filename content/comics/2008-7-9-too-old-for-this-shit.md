[Two Cueballs are standing in front of a whiteboard covered with equations. They are facing away from each other, not yet fully conversing with each other.]

Cueball 1: I wish I could do math like when I was young.

Cueball 2: Huh?

[The two now face each other. They talk to each other.]

Cueball 1: It doesn't come easy like it once did.

Cueball 2: Uh huh.

[Still talking.]

Cueball 1: Math is a game for the young. I need to sit back and let the future happen.

[Still talking.]

Cueball 2: You're thirteen.

Cueball 1: Yes, and it's time I accept that.
