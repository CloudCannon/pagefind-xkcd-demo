[Cueball is holding his hands up while giving a lecture to an off panel audience.]

Cueball: There are four fundamental forces between particles:

(1) ***Gravity***, which obeys this inverse square law:

 F<sub>gravity</sub> = G m<sub>1</sub>m<sub>2</sub>/d<sup>2</sup>

<!-- When math arrives, use the following:

 <math>F\_{gravity}=G\frac{m\_1m\_2}{d^2}</math> -->

Off panel audience: OK...

[Cueball is still holding his hands up while continues the lecture to the off panel audience.]

Cueball: (2) ***Electromagnetism***, which obeys *this* inverse-square law:

F<sub>static</sub> = K<sub>e</sub> q<sub>1</sub>q<sub>2</sub>/d<sup>2</sup>

<!-- When math arrives, use the following:

 <math>F\_{static}=K\_e\frac{q\_1q\_2}{d^2}</math> -->

...and also Maxwell's equations

Off panel audience: Also what?

[Zoom in on Cueball as he continues the lecture to the off panel audience.]

Cueball: (3) The ***strong nuclear force***, which obeys, uh ...

...well, umm...

...it holds protons and neutrons together.

Off panel audience: I see.

Cueball: It's strong.

[Cueball finishes the lecture to the off panel audience and spreads out his arm for the final remark.]

Cueball: And (4) the ***weak force***. It [mumble mumble] radioactive decay [mumble mumble]

Off panel audience: That's not a sentence. You just said “Radio-

Cueball: – ***And those are the four fundamental forces!***
