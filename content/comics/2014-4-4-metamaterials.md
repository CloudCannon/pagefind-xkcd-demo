[An image of a violet that is colored red.]

Megan (off-screen):

[An image of a rose that is colored blue.]

Megan (off-screen):

[Megan and Cueball are standing around a table, on which a screen is in front of the rose and violet. Megan is in front of a lectern with a mic. All of this is on a stage.]

Megan:
