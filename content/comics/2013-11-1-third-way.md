  'The monospaced-typewriter-font story is a COMPLETE FABRICATION!  WAKE UP, SHEEPLE' 'It doesn't matter! Studies support single spaces!' 'Those results weren't statistically significant!' 'Fine, you win. I'm using double spaces right now!' 'Are not!  We can all hear your stupid whitespace.'

[[Two groups stand, with placards and weapons, angrily facing off against each other. The first group, with a cutlass, has a sign reading "TWO spaces after a period". The second group, with a spear, has a sign reading "ONE space after a period." Off to one side stands a figure, alone, with a placard reading "Line break after every sentence."]]
