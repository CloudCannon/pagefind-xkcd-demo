  'I'm here to return what Prometheus stole.' would be a good thing to say if you were a fighter pilot in a Michael Bay movie where for some reason the world's militaries had to team up to defeat every god from human mythology, and you'd just broken through the perimeter and gotten a missile lock on Mount Olympus.

[Cueball addresses his Cueball-like friend, who just walked in-panel. Cueball points at Prometheus (who is also Cueball-like). Prometheus is holding his hand to his chin and holding a colorful flaming torch in the other hand.]

Cueball: Prometheus has stolen fire from the Gods!

Prometheus:

Well, sort of.

I mean, when you use a fire to make another fire, the first fire doesn't go away.

So really, it's more like "sharing".

Fire wants to be free.
