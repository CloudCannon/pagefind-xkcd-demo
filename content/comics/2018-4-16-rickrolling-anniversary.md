[Cueball and Megan are walking.]

Cueball: This month marks ten years since the peak of the Rickrolling phenomenon.

[In a frame-less panel they keep walking.]

Megan: Seriously?

Megan: Wow. Happy anniversary, I guess.

[They keep walking silently, beat panel.]

[And they walk on.]

Cueball: We've known each other for so long.

Megan: We really have.
