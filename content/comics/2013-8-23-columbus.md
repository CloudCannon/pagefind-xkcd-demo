[White Hat talks to two children sitting in front of him on the floor to the right. A boy with hair like Hairy with his arms round his knees and behind him Jill with two hair buns, sitting cross-legged on her knees. Megan interrupts him from off-panel right.]

White Hat: Everyone said the world was flat, but Columbus knew it was round.

Megan (off-panel): \*Sigh\* no, no, no.

[Megan walks in holding a hand palm up. White Hat partly lifts his arm closest to her. The children between them turn their heads towards her. The boy leans back on one hand.]

Megan: So he took his ships and sailed west—

Megan: —in a line tangent to the surface. The sea fell away, and he landed in *Valinor.*

[White Hat has taken his arm down, Megan holds her arms out to each side. The children still look at her, now also Jill leans back on one arm.]

Megan: A Silmaril on his brow, he wanders the heavens as the morning star, still believing he reached India.

White Hat: Stop making stuff up.

Megan: You first.
