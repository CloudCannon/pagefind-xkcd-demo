[A chart of the Standard Model of particle physics with red marks all over the chart.]


Changes I would make to the Standard Model

[In reading order:]


u up, connected to the down quark below.


c charm, connected to the strange quark below, in faded gray with a red l left written over it. Above is a red note with an arrow pointing to the¬†:charm quark. The note reads,


Consistent quark names (use "strange" and "charm" for bosons)


t top, connected to the bottom quark below.


g gluon


H Higgs, in faded gray with a red V Vin Diesel writted over it. To the right is a red note with an arrow pointing to the Higgs boson, which reads,


With all respect to Peter H, the Higgs boson needs a flashier name


d down, connected to the up quark above.


s strange, connected to the charm quark above, in faded gray with a red r right written over it.


b bottom, connected to the top quark above.


Œ≥ photon


G graviton, in red with a red border. To the right is a red note with an arrow pointing to the graviton, which reads,


Let's just include it, it's probably fine


e electron, connected to the electron neutrino below.


¬µ muon, connected in faded gray to the muon neutrino below, with red rounded corners cutting it off.


œÑ tau, connected to the tau neutrino below, in faded gray with a red scribble over it. On the tau lepton is a red note which reads,


No one needs tau leptons


Z Z boson, with the Z symbol and the Z in the name in faded gray. The symbol has a red s written over it and the Z in the name is scribbled out in¬†:red. The word strange is written in red between the symbol and the name.


M magic, in red with a red border. To the right is a red note with an arrow pointing to the magic particle, which reads,


Decoy particle for people making nonsense claims about "quantum" philosophy stuff


v e electron neutrino, with the e as a subscript of the v, connected to the electron above. The v is in faded gray and a red N with a circle around it is written on it. Below is a red note with an arrow pointing to the electron neutrino, which reads,


Fix neutrino symbol so I stop mixing up ŒΩ and v


v Œº muon neutrino, with the ¬µ as a subscript of the v, connected to the muon above, in faded gray with a red scribble over it. On the muon neutrino is a red note which reads,


Too many neutrinos


v œÑ tau neutrino, with the œÑ as a subscript of the v, connected to the tau lepton above, in faded gray. Written over it is a D dark matter in red with a red border. Below the tau neutrino is a red note with an arrow pointing to it, which reads,


We found it!


W W boson, with the W symbol and the W in the name in faded gray. The symbol has a red c written over it and the W in the name is scribbled out in red. The word charm is written in red between the symbol and the name.


üêû cool bugs, in red with a red border. To the right is a red note with an arrow pointing to cool bugs, which reads,


Very small bugs are fundamental particles now
