[A chart of the Standard Model of particle physics with red marks all over the chart.]<br />

Changes I would make to the Standard Model

[In reading order:]<br/>

u up, connected to the down quark below.<br />

c charm, connected to the strange quark below, in faded gray with a red l left written over it. Above is a red note with an arrow pointing to the :charm quark. The note reads,<br />

Consistent quark names (use "strange" and "charm" for bosons)<br />

t top, connected to the bottom quark below.<br />

g gluon<br />

H Higgs, in faded gray with a red V Vin Diesel writted over it. To the right is a red note with an arrow pointing to the Higgs boson, which reads,<br />

With all respect to Peter H, the Higgs boson needs a flashier name<br />

d down, connected to the up quark above.<br />

s strange, connected to the charm quark above, in faded gray with a red r right written over it.<br />

b bottom, connected to the top quark above.<br />

Œ≥ photon<br />

G graviton, in red with a red border. To the right is a red note with an arrow pointing to the graviton, which reads,<br />

Let's just include it, it's probably fine<br />

e electron, connected to the electron neutrino below.<br />

¬µ muon, connected in faded gray to the muon neutrino below, with red rounded corners cutting it off.<br />

œÑ tau, connected to the tau neutrino below, in faded gray with a red scribble over it. On the tau lepton is a red note which reads,<br />

No one needs tau leptons<br />

Z Z boson, with the Z symbol and the Z in the name in faded gray. The symbol has a red s written over it and the Z in the name is scribbled out in :red. The word strange is written in red between the symbol and the name.<br />

M magic, in red with a red border. To the right is a red note with an arrow pointing to the magic particle, which reads,<br />

Decoy particle for people making nonsense claims about "quantum" philosophy stuff<br />

v e electron neutrino, with the e as a subscript of the v, connected to the electron above. The v is in faded gray and a red N with a circle around it is written on it. Below is a red note with an arrow pointing to the electron neutrino, which reads,<br />

Fix neutrino symbol so I stop mixing up ŒΩ and v<br />

v Œº muon neutrino, with the ¬µ as a subscript of the v, connected to the muon above, in faded gray with a red scribble over it. On the muon neutrino is a red note which reads,<br />

Too many neutrinos<br />

v œÑ tau neutrino, with the œÑ as a subscript of the v, connected to the tau lepton above, in faded gray. Written over it is a D dark matter in red with a red border. Below the tau neutrino is a red note with an arrow pointing to it, which reads,<br />

We found it!<br />

W W boson, with the W symbol and the W in the name in faded gray. The symbol has a red c written over it and the W in the name is scribbled out in red. The word charm is written in red between the symbol and the name.<br />

üêû cool bugs, in red with a red border. To the right is a red note with an arrow pointing to cool bugs, which reads,<br />

Very small bugs are fundamental particles now
