  If I'm not going to upgrade to a powered one, I should at LEAST stop leaving the door open so often.

[Cueball is holding a compressed, accordion-like device. He is walking right outside, keeping the device compressed, as indicated with movement lines around it and his arms. The door and the wall it is attached to are white, while the floor, the two steps down to the ground, and the ground outside are black. The inside of the house has a light red shade, along with the device. The background outside is light blue.]

[The panel has panned right to show more of the outside. Cueball has closed the door and walked down the steps, but is still walking away from the house, while continuing to keep the device contracted. The colors of the background and the device are the same as in the first panel.]

[Same setting as previous panel. Cueball has stopped just a pace out from the stairs. Here he releases the pressure on the device, opening his arms to accommodate the size of the device. This turns the inside of the device a darker blue than the light blue background. Above Cueball is a description of what he did:]

*Release*

[Same setting as previous panel. Cueball looks behind him at the closed door, while the device has turned back to light blue, matching the color of the background.]

[The panel has panned back to the original setting. Cueball is walking into the house. The device has not changed appearance.]

[Same setting as previous panel. Cueball stops just inside. He has closed the door. He squeezes the device between his hands, using great force as indicated with movement lines around his elbows. The device is now as compressed as in the first panel, but now it has turned deep red, darker than the light red background inside the house. Above Cueball is a description of what he did:]

*Squeeze*

[Same setting as previous panel. Cueball looks at the door while holding the compressed device away from him. It is clearly glowing with many red lines radiating away from it. Although the inside of the device is still much darker than the light red color inside the house, it is a lighter red than before. Above Cueball is a description of what happens:]

*Radiate*

[Same setting as previous panel. Cueball is again walking out of the now open door. The color inside the house is now a darker red than in all the previous panels. The device has the same color as the inside. The background outside has not changed.]

[Caption below the panel:]

Manual heat pumps are such a pain.
