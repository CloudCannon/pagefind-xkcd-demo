[Cueball is sitting at a table with a laptop open. His hands are on the keys.]

Cueball: Hah- Neil DeGrasse Tyson has a great reply to people who doubt astronauts went to the moon.

Voice off-screen: Oh?

Cueball: "Atop 3,000 tons of rocket fuel, where *else* do you think they were headed?"

[The voice off screen turns out to be Megan. She is depicted, and now Cueball is off-screen.]

Megan: Cute. But it overlooks an even simpler argument.

Cueball: Which is?

[Both Megan and Cueball are now visible. Cueball has turned his chair around to face her.]

Megan: If NASA were willing to fake great accomplishments, they'd have a second one by now.

Cueball: *Ouch.*

Megan: ...Too mean?

Cueball: That burn was so harsh I think you deorbited.
