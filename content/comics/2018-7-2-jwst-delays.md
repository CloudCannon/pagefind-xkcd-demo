  Since delays should get less likely closer to the launch, most astronomers in 2018 believed the expansion of the schedule was slowing, but by early 2020 new measurements indicated that it was actually accelerating.

Launch Delays

[There is a positive-quadrant only line graph. The x- axis is labeled 'Current Date' and the y axis is labeled 'Planned Launch Date'. The dates on both of the axes range from 1995 to 2030.]

[In the graph are 15 points, starting at (1997,2007) and extending at a slope of a little less than one. The most recent one is labeled 'Now: 2021'.]

[There are two lines on the graph: a red one and a dashed black one. The red one is a regression of the points on the graph. It has a slope of about â…”. The black one is a line with a slope of one. They intersect at the point (2026,2026), marked by the label 'Late 2026'?]

Look, at least the slope is less than one.
