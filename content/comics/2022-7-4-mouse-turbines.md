[Megan and Beret Guy are walking on grass.]

Beret Guy: Ahh, summer!

Beret Guy: The clouds are big, the bugs are zooming,

[Beret Guy stops walking. There are three small trefoil structures and a tiny building on the grass in front of him.]

Beret Guy: and the field mice have put up their little wind turbines.

[Beret Guy picks up one of the turbines. Under the turbine there is a wire attached to the ground.]

Megan (off-panel): You mean dandelions?

Beret Guy: No.

[Beret Guy holds the turbine in front of him.]

Beret Guy: Make a wish!

[Beret Guy blows into the turbine blades and makes them spin. The wire transfers electricity towards the ground.]
