[Cueball and Megan, flying in a hot air balloon that takes up most of the panel.]

Cueball: I like you. I'm just not feeling the relationship.

[The hot air balloon is now further away, and a rough sketch of the ground below with possible shoreline features is shown.]

Cueball: I'm sorry.

Cueball: It's just bad timing. Me with my classes, you with your work, the spiders...

Megan: The what?

[Red Spiders crowd onto the balloon, causing it to begin to fall. Cueball and Megan look panicked.]
