[Ponytail is speaking to young Cueball sitting in front of a TV with a black background and a white ring.]

Ponytail: You watched the tape!?

Cueball: Yeah, sorry.

Ponytail: Now you'll die in seven days!

Cueball: It's worse than that.

[TV is cut from the frame.]

Ponytail: ...You didn't.

Cueball: Yup.

[Both are now in front of a computer, Ponytail leaning in.]

Ponytail: Great, it's got 363,104 views *already*.

Cueball: They kept Rickrolling me!

Cueball: It was only fair.
