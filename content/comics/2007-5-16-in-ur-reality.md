[Black Hat is holding a cat and a piece of paper. Cueball has raised his arms. There are three cats with captions stuck to them. One cat may be trying to remove the caption from itself, or toying with it playfully, as it rolls around on its back and makes noises.]

Black Hat: Oh hi; I'm here from the Internet.

Cueball: What are you doing!?

Black Hat: Gluing captions to your cats.

Cat: <small>*RRRR*</small>
