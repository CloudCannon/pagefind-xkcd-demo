  How about posts that are public, but every time a company accesses a bunch of them, the API makes their CEO’s account click 'like’ on one of them at random so you get a notification.

[Cueball floating in midair is communicating with a small floating screen that resembles a smartphone. Other people and clouds visible floating by in background.]

Screen: Welcome to social media! When you put stuff here, you have two options: (1) You can make it available to a small set of 300 or so approved friends.

[Cueball is still floating and talking with the smartphone. Other people and clouds visible floating by in background.]

Screen: Or (2) you can share permanent copies of it all with billions of people, including internet scammers, random predatory companies, and hostile governments.

[In a frameless panel, Cueball has stopped moving and is facing the screen]

Cueball: Why would anyone pick option two?

Screen: Two is the default.

Cueball: Yikes.

[Cueball is still floating and talking with the smartphone. Other people and clouds visible floating by in background. Cueball has his hand raised]

Cueball: So those are the only two options? There’s nothing in between?

Screen: I don’t understand. Like what?

[Cueball continues floating and talking with the smartphone. Other people and clouds visible floating by in background.]

Cueball: I mean...there are numbers between 300 and a billion.

Screen: Huh? Name one.

Screen: *Pretty* sure I would have heard of those.
