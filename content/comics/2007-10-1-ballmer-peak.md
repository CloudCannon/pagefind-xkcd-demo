[[A graph with "programming skill" on the X-axis and "blood alcohol concentration" on the Y one]]

[[A man is making a presentation with the graph]]

Presenter: Called the Ballmer Peak, it was discovered by Microsoft in the 80's. The cause is unknown but somehow a B.A.C between 0.129% and 0.138% confers superhuman programming ability.

Presenter: However, it's a delicate effect requiring careful calibration--you can't just give a team of coders a year's supply of whiskey and tell them to get cracking.

Man in public: ...Has that ever happened.

Presenter: Remember Windows ME?

Man: I knew it!
