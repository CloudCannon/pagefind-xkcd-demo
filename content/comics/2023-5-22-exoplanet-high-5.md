[A diagram of messages transmitted between the Earth and Proxima Centauri b is shown. An image of the Earth is on the left and Proxima Centauri b on the right at the top, and below each is a vertical timeline. The message transmissions are shown as arrows pointing from one side to the other, between labeled dots on both timelines, and in the middle of them are five distinct depictions of Cueball interacting with an alien. The final Proxima Centauri b action is shown as a labeled asterisk on its timeline.]
