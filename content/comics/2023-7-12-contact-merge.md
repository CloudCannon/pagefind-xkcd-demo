[Cueball is holding a phone and chatting in DMs]

Cueball: @Surf King Weird, my phone keeps trying to merge your contact with John's

Surf King: ...

Cueball: Hey, you two should meet up-He's into surfing too

Surf King: Oh my God

Surf King: Are you serious

Surf King: You've been in this chat with me for **four years!**

[Caption below the panel:]

I wonder who holds the record for accidentally doing this the longest.
