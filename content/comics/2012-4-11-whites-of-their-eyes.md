[A Revolutionary War soldier gives orders to two others hunkered down behind a rock.]

Lead soldier: Don't shoot until you see the whites of their eyes

Lead: And smell the scent of their hair.

[The two others getting an incredulous look on their faces. They glance at each other.]

Lead: And taste the sweetness of their lips.

[They begin taking fire from the opposition.]

Lead: And feel the heat of their skin pressed against yours, trembling as you-

Soldier 2: Maybe we should just start shooting.

Lead: Right, yes.
