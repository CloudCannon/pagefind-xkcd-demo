  Guess who has two thumbs and spent the night in an ER after trying to rescue a kitten that ran under his car at a stoplight and climbed up into the engine compartment? And, thanks to antibiotics, will continue having two thumbs? THIS GUY. (P.S. kitten is safe!)

[A simple X and Y graph, with the X labeled "how bad it is if you don't know {thing}" and ranging from "not bad" to "very bad", and Y labeled "how easy it is to grow up without learning {thing}" and ranging from "easy" to "hard" from top to bottom.]

[Points on graph from top to bottom on the left side of the Y-axis:]

100 digits of pi

Lyrics to We Didn't Start the Fire

How to ride a bike

How to escape movie quicksand

Lyrics to 12 Days of Christmas

TV theme songs

[Points on graph from top to bottom on the right side of the Y-axis:]

That cat bites are really serious and if bitten you should wash the bite and call a doctor immediately

Red flags for an abusive relationship

Signs for a stroke

Cough into your elbow, not your hand

That you have to empty the dryer lint trap

Stop, drop, and roll

That you have to pay taxes
