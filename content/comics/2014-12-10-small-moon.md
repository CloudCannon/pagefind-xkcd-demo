[Millennium Falcon follows a Tie Fighter towards an unidentified orb in the distance.]

Luke Skywalker: He's heading for that small moon.

Ben Kenobi: That's no moon - it's a space station.

Luke Skywalker: It's too big to be a space station.

Ben Kenobi: But it's too ***small*** to be a moon.

[Three hours pass]

Ben Kenobi: Fine! What if we agree it's not a moon, but we make a new category called "Dwarf Moon"?

Luke Skywalker: And what's the cutoff, asshole?! Is this ***ship*** a dwarf moon now?

Ben Kenobi: Screw you.
