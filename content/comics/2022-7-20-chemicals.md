[Megan and Cueball standing next to each other. Megan has her palms raised.]

Megan: You know how our company spends a lot on expensive chemicals?

Cueball: Yeah?

[Zoom in on Megan who is holding piece of paper up in one hand. The paper has a large chemical formula at the top. Below is a list of the atoms needed, with amount and a price tag in dollars but with unreadable amount. There is a sum total at the bottom beneath a line.]

Megan: Well, I just learned you can look up all of the formulas online!

Megan: We can just buy the atoms in bulk and assemble them here!

Paper:

<big>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>NO<sub>2</sub></big>

Carbon 6 $...

Hydrogen 5 $...

Nitrogen 1 $...

<u>Oxygen 2 $...</u>

Total 14 $...

[Cueball is now on the left of Megan as she is walking past him to the right holding her arms outstretched with her palms up.]

Cueball: I wonder why more places don't do that.

Megan: People have no idea they're getting ripped off by Big Molecule!
