[Cueball stands behind Blondie who has turned her head towards him while sitting at a bar stool at a bar desk. She holds on to a wine glass standing on the desk. Two regular glasses are standing on the desk in front of her.]

Cueball: Baby, if I could rearrange the alphabet, I'd forget about you in a *heartbeat*.
