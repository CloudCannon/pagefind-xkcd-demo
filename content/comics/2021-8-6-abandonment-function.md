[A multi-Rotor drone is seen flying though the air from left to right. Tied below the drones main body is the drone's own remote controller. Movement lines behind drone indicate a wavery flight path. A voice emanates from the drone:]

Drone: Hi, I'm yours now! Please charge me!

Drone: Hi, I'm yours now! Please charge me!
