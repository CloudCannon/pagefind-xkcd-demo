[Cueball is standing in a kitchen, looking at bottle with label which he is holding in his hand. He is talking to a person off-panel behind him, who replies. There is a cupboard above him, with stuff protruding from the shelves. Below that is a counter, with a drawer and a cupboard. There is an  bottle with fluid, a can and a jar on top. Only the latter two has labels.]

Cueball: Oh wow, pre-pandemic ketchup!

Cueball: We haven't bought this kind since before.

Cueball: I'm gonna toss it.

(off-screen): Eww, yes.

Spring 2020 forms a weird dividing line in my kitchen.
