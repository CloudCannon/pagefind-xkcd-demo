[Caption to the left of the comic. There is a sign looking like an infinity sign with two lines near the middle below the heading:]

<big>Texting Tip</big>

Is your reaction too intense to be expressed in an emoji or gif?

Try using driving directions!

The extra research it requires shows how strongly you feel.

[A split panel showing Ponytail in the top part holding her smartphone up while texting, as shown with movement lines on either side of her hands holding the phone. Her text messages are shown above her in gray frames. In the bottom part Cueball is shown reading her messages on his smart phone he holds up in one hand. His reaction is shown as a dark cloud above his head.]

Ponytail's text: You should name your new Honda Civic *The Treaty of Edinburgh*

Ponytail's text: Because it's a Tudor compact

Ponytail's text: Get it

[Cueball replies to Ponytail, with his text message shown above him as he types on his smartphone held up in both hands, with movement lines on either side of the phone. He is looking to the left. Ponytail's last text in a gray frame is shown above his reply. Cueball sends Ponytail a screenshot of driving directions between two cities with four stops on the way. Each of the stops as well as the starting point are marked with a circle. A blue line connects the dots and the destination is marked with a red Google pin. The map beneath it is drawn with gray lines and outlines most of the mainland USA except for the western most part and the tip of Texas. The country boarders are drawn with thick gray lines and the US state boarders are drawn with thin gray lines. Some parts of Canada and Mexico are also included. The six destinations used in the direction is named, using normal black font, with the state or other specification written in gray text after the destination name. Here written in the driving order from start to destination:]

[Cueball continues to text Ponytail, with his text message shown above him as he types on his smartphone held up in both hands, with movement lines on either side of the phone. He has turned to look straight out of the panel. He sends Ponytail another screenshot of driving directions with a similar map type as in the previous panel, but this time with only three destinations. The map this time only shows the middle to eastern part of the USA, with more focus on for instance the Great Lakes. Here written in the driving order from start to destination:]
