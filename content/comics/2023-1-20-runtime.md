[Two situations are depicted between White Hat and Cueball.]

[Situation 1:]

White Hat: You should keep watching! After the first season it gets really good.

Cueball: Oh yeah, I've heard that!

[Situation 2:]

White Hat: You should keep watching! After the first 8 movies, they get really good.

Cueball: Haha, what? I'm not going to sit through ***eight*** bad movies!

[Caption below the panel:]

It's weird how it's way more normal and socially acceptable to suggest someone spend 10-15 hours watching something when it's TV rather than movies.
