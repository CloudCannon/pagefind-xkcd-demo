[[A man and a woman are standing, talking to one another]]

Man: This weekend, my professor friend built a time machine out of a DeLorean and I went back in time! I helped make sure my parents got together and helped my dad to be less of a loser.

Woman: Wow! Do you still have the time machine?

Man: Nah. But I did what I really needed to do.

Woman: Uh huh.

[[Neither says anything]]

Woman: Okay, you remember that my father was in the WTC North Tower, right? 

Man: Yeah...why?

Woman: I...nothing.
