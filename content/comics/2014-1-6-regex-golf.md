Regex golf:

[Megan is sitting at a laptop. Cueball is standing behind her.]

Megan: You try to match one group but not the other.

Megan: /m | [tn]|b/ matches *Star Wars* subtitles but not *Star Trek*.

Cueball: Cool.

Meta-regex golf:

[A close-up of Megan at her laptop.]

Megan: So I wrote a program that plays regex golf with arbitrary lists...

Cueball (offscreen): Uh oh...

Meta-meta-regex golf:

[Megan typing at her laptop.]

Megan: ...But I lost my code, so I'm grepping for files that look like regex golf solvers.

[Cueball facepalming.]

[Caption at top of panel:]

...And beyond:

[Another closeup of Megan at her laptop.]

Megan: Really, this is all /(meta-)\*regex golf/.

Cueball: Now you have *infinite* problems.

Megan: No, I had those already.
