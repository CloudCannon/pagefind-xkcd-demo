Narrator: I hate how when I'm talking while I type, sometimes I accidentally type a word I'm saying.

[[A man is sitting at a computer.]]

Computer: Wanna go get food later?

[[A woman runs over, holding a giraffe.]]

Woman: Check out what I found in the closet!

<<Type type>>

Man ((typing)): Sorry, I really shouldn't.

Man ((talking)): Aww, what an adorable stuffed giraffe!

<<Type type>>

Man ((typing)): I can't afford to keep eating out this giraffe.

Narrator: 

Frequently!

 I meant 

'frequently'!
