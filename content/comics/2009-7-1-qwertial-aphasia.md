I hate how when I'm talking while I type, sometimes I accidentally type a word I'm saying.

[Cueball is sitting at a computer chatting with a friend. The friends message "comes" out of the computer.]

Friend (from computer): Wanna go get food later?

[Megan walks in to the frame, holding a small stuffed giraffe in front of her. Cueball is in the middle of typing his reply, which "comes" from the keyboard.]

Megan: Check out what I found in the closet!

Cueball (from keyboard): Sorry, I really shouldn't.

Keyboard: *Type type*

[Megan has stopped and Cueball turns to look at her and the giraffe, while continuing to type.]

Cueball: Aww, what an adorable stuffed giraffe!

Cueball (from keyboard): I can't afford to keep eating out this giraffe.

Keyboard: *Type type*
