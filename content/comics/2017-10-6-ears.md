  My theory is that most humans have been colonized with alien mind-control slugs that hold the earbuds for them, and the ones who can't wear earbuds are the only surviving free ones.

[Cueball is sitting with his back towards Megan who is lying on her back on a grassy hill. Both are looking up at a sky with small puffy clouds (one large, two small, and four tiny). In the background fields are visible below their vantage point.]

[Same setting, but with the clouds removed, to make room for Cueball's text.]

Cueball: Do you ever just look up at the sky and wonder...

[Same setting, zoomed a bit out to make more of the background fields visible, still with the clouds missing due to the text from the two people.]

Cueball: "What are normal peoples' ears shaped like, that earbuds stay in without falling out?"

Megan: Man, who *knows* what's going on in there.
