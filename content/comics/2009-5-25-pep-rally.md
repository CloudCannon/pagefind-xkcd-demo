  You know, pep rallies weirded me out in high school, and they've only gotten creepier in retrospect.

[Ponytail stands in front of crowded bleachers (with only Cueballs in it), waving pompoms high in the air.]

Ponytail: Lakeview High is the best!

Crowd: Yeah!

Voice #1: Wait, why?

[Zoom on Ponytail, now with her hands and pompoms down.]

Ponytail: What?

Voice #1 (off-screen): A guy on the North High football team helped me rebuild my deck.

Voice #1 (off-screen): It seems ungrateful to presume we're better.

[Same picture with Ponytail now just listening.]

Voice #1 (off-screen): I mean, school districts are just based on zip codes.

Voice #2 (off-screen): Their principal donated a kidney to my dad.

[Ponytail looks down, holding up her pompoms.]

Voice #1 (off-screen): I'm texting with my friend there now. He says it's okay, and we're invited to their events if we want.

Voice #1 (off-screen): But he sounded kind of hurt.

Voice #2 (off-screen): Why are we doing this rally, again?
