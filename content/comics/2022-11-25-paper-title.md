[Megan is standing behind and looking over the shoulder of Cueball who is sitting in his office chair at his desk typing on the keyboard. A line from the keyboard goes up to text boxes above them, showing a paper title followed by a cursor:]

Paper title:

 *Check out this cool microbe we found*|

[Pan to only showing Megan who has taken a hand up to her chin. Cueball replies from off-panel.]

Megan: Isnâ€™t science supposed to be about formulating a hypothesis and then testing it?

Cueball - off panel: Oh. Yeah, I guess.

[Same setting as in the first panel, but now the title has changed:]

Paper title:

 *Is our lab really good at finding cool microbes? Some preliminary data*|
