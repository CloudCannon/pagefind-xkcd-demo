[A flowchart with 11 similar boxes on a line connected with arrows. After 8 there is two branches, one up (with three boxes above the rest of the 11 boxes) and one down to one box. After 10 there is one branch down to a larger box with two lines, and after that the last arrow is longer before reaching the last and 11th box. From this box there is an arrow that loops around to the last box again. This arrow is labeled.]

Na → Na → Na → Na → Na → Na → Na → Na → Na → Na → Na

Up 8 branch:→ Hey → Hey → Goodbye

Down 8 branch:→ Batman!

Down 10 branch:→ Katamari Damacy!
