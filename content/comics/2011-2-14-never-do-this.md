[[Guy brings in a pocket microscope]]

Guy: Check it out - a pocket microscope!

Girl: Ooh! Let's look at stuff!

[[Guy holds a pencil; girl peers at a quarter through the microscope]]

Guy: The tip of this pencil is neat!

Girl: This quarter is really scratched.

Guy: Let's look at the skin under our fingernails!

Minutes later...

[[Guy and girl curl up in a pit of despair]]

Guy and girl: oh god oh god
