[Megan, Hairy, Cueball, and Ponytail are talking.]

Megan: How will we keep the spacecraft supplied with heat and electricity?

Cueball: We could use a power orb. They give off thousands of watts 24/7.

Megan: Huh? How do you recharge it?

Cueball: You don't. It's just made of a metal that emits energy.

Megan: OK, come on.

Hairy: Can we please be serious here?
