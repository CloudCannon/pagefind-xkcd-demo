[An apparent generalisation of a scientific expression consisting of a dotted rectangular 'box' outline, left empty, and various commonly-themed symbology around it:]

[as normal text, to the left of all the rest:] 2

[superscript to the immediate left of the box:] 2

[subscript also to the immediate left of the box:] 2

[superscript to the immediate right of the box:] 2

[subscript also to the immediate right of the box:] 2;2 [i.e. separated by a semicolon]

[as normal text, to the right of almost all the rest:] (2) [i.e. enclosed in standard parentheses]

[smaller subscript, centered immediately beneath the 2 within the parentheses:] 2

[Further details are drawn in grey tone, around or near various of the elements of the expression:]

;[Captions above the numbers]

[with an arrow pointing to the leftmost 2:] Regular Math

[with an arrow pointing to the leftwards superscript 2:] Physics

[with an arrow pointing to the rightwards superscript 2:] Regular math or footnotes

[with an arrow pointing to the parenthetical 2 at the right:] Either high school math functions or incomprehensible group theory

;[Captions below the numbers]

[with an arrow pointing to the leftwards subscript 2:] Chemical Physics

[with an arrow pointing to just the rightwards subscript 2:] Chemistry

[with an arrow pointing to a distorted grey ring snaking around only the comma of the semicolon and the following 2 of the rightmost subscript:] Matrices!

[with an arrow pointing to a larger grey ring that passes fully around the whole semicolon and final 2 of the rightmost subscript:] The physicists are at it again

[with an arrow pointing to the small 2 placed below the parenthetical 2:] Oh no. Whatever this is, it's cursed.
