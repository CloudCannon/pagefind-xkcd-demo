! Property

! Type/scale

|-

| Electric charge

| [Scale with -1, 0 and +1 labeled and markings dividing the units in thirds. The endpoints are both dots.]

|-

| Mass

| [Scale with 0, 1kg and 2kg labeled and markings dividing the units into thirds. The endpoints are a dot on the zero end and an arrow on the other end.]

|-

| Spin number

| [Scale with -1, -½, 0, ½ and 1 labeled and no additional markings. The endpoints are both arrows, pointing out.]

|-

| Flavor

| (Misc. quantum numbers)

|-

| Color charge

| [Coordinate system of three axes labeled R, G and B clockwise from the 10 o'clock position. Endpoints are arrow-dots on all ends, with black dots for the labeled ends and white dots for the unlabeled ends.] (Quarks only)

|-

| Mood

| [Scale labeled with 5 emoticons, from angry to happy, and markings dividing the units in thirds. Endpoints are both arrows, pointing out.]

|-

| Alignment

| [3x3 grid with varying shades] Good-Evil, Lawful-Chaotic

|-

| Hit points

| [Scale starting from 0, markings but no labels other than zero. Endpoints are a dot at zero end and an arrow at the other end.]

|-

| Rating

| [Star rating of 3.5/5 stars.]

|-

| String type

| Bytestring-Charstring

|-

| Batting average

| [Scale from 0% to 100%. Endpoints are dot at 0% end and arrow-dot at 100% end.]

|-

| Proof

| [Scale from 0 to 200. Endpoints are dot at 0 end and arrow-dot at 200 end.]

|-

| Heat

| [Scale labeled with pepper icons, from 0 (a grayed-out pepper) to 3 black peppers. Endpoints are a dot at zero end and an arrow at the other end.]

|-

| Street value

| [Scale with $0, $100 and $200 labeled. Endpoints are a dot at zero end and an arrow at the other end.]

|-

| Entropy

| (This already has like 20 different confusing meanings, so it probably means something here, too.)
