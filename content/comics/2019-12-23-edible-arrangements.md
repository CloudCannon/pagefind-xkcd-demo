[Cueball and Megan are sitting on opposite sides of a leafless tree. They are silhouetted.]

Cueball: I don't get how Edible Arrangements is a thing.

[Zoomed in on Cueball and Megan leaning against the tree]

Megan: That's easy &mdash; picking out presents is hard and fruit is delicious.

Cueball: Yeah, true.

[Megan gestures with an open hand]

Megan: But my question is, why did they call it "Edible Arrangements" and not "Vore of the Roses"?

[Pan to just Megan. Megan turns to face Cueball]

Cueball: Just for that, I'm going to cancel the one I got you.

Megan: Nooo! I want my Mouth Blossoms!

Megan: My Juicy Bouquet! My Oral Floral!

Megan: Hey, come back!
