[Cueball is trying to barricade a door with his own body (although it already has a bar in front of it). He is in a room that is deteriorating with Hairbun who is loading a shotgun while sitting behind some sort of box.]

Knocking on the door: **Thump Thump**

Voice: **Which Spice Girl are you?!**

Voice: The merciful one, or the one who started this war?

When I see those quiz titles, I like to imagine they're being shouted through a door in a postapocalyptic dystopia.
